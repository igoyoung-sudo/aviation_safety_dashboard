31 Oct 1994,ATR 72-212,N401AM,"American Eagle, opb Simmons Airlines",68,"near Roselawn, IN",w/o,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/324871,ATR 72 (all series),_AT72,15:59,401,P&W Canada PW127,Fatalities: 68 / Occupants: 68,0,Accident,Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,"Indianapolis International Airport, IN (IND/KIND)","Chicago-O'Hare International Airport, IL (ORD/KORD)","American Eagle flight 4184, an ATR 72-212, crashed near Roselawn, Indiana, USA, following a loss of control in icing conditions while on approach to Chicago-O'Hare Airport, IL, USA, killing all 68 occupants.

Flight 4184 was scheduled to depart the gate in Indianapolis at 14:10; however, due to a change in the traffic flow because of deteriorating weather conditions at destination Chicago-O'Hare, the flight left the gate at 14:14 and was held on the ground for 42 minutes before receiving an IFR clearance to O'Hare. At 14:55, the controller cleared flight 4184 for takeoff. The aircraft climbed to an enroute altitude of 16,300 feet. At 15:13, flight 4184 began the descent to 10,000 feet. During the descent, the FDR recorded the activation of the Level III airframe de-icing system. At 15:18, shortly after flight 4184 leveled off at 10,000 feet, the crew received a clearance to enter a holding pattern near the LUCIT intersection and they were told to expect further clearance at 15:45, which was revised to 16:00 at 15:38. Three minutes later the Level III airframe de-icing system activated again. At 15:56, the controller contacted flight 4184 and instructed the flight crew to descend to 8,000 feet. The engine power was reduced to the flight idle position, the propeller speed was 86 percent, and the autopilot remained engaged in the vertical speed (VS) and heading select (HDG SEL) modes. At 15:57:21, as the airplane was descending in a 15-degree right-wing-down attitude at 186 KIAS, the sound of the flap overspeed warning was recorded on the CVR. The crew selected flaps from 15 to zero degrees and the AOA and pitch attitude began to increase. At 15:57:33, as the airplane was descending through 9,130 feet, the AOA increased through 5 degrees, and the ailerons began deflecting to a right-wing-down position. About 1/2 second later, the ailerons rapidly deflected to 13:43 degrees right-wing-down, the autopilot disconnected. The airplane rolled rapidly to the right, and the pitch attitude and AOA began to decrease. Within several seconds of the initial aileron and roll excursion, the AOA decreased through 3.5 degrees, the ailerons moved to a nearly neutral position, and the airplane stopped rolling at 77 degrees right-wing-down. The airplane then began to roll to the left toward a wings-level attitude, the elevator began moving in a nose-up direction, the AOA began increasing, and the pitch attitude stopped at approximately 15 degrees nose down. At 15:57:38, as the airplane rolled back to the left through 59 degrees right-wing-down (towards wings level), the AOA increased again through 5 degrees and the ailerons again deflected rapidly to a right-wing-down position. The captain's nose-up control column force exceeded 22 pounds, and the airplane rolled rapidly to the right, at a rate in excess of 50 degrees per second. The captain's nose-up control column force decreased below 22 pounds as the airplane rolled through 120 degrees, and the first officer's nose-up control column force exceeded 22 pounds just after the airplane rolled through the inverted position (180 degrees). Nose-up elevator inputs were indicated on the FDR throughout the roll, and the AOA increased when nose-up elevator increased. At 15:57:45 the airplane rolled through the wings-level attitude (completion of first full roll). The nose-up elevator and AOA then decreased rapidly, the ailerons immediately deflected to 6 degrees left-wing-down and then stabilized at about 1 degree right-wing-down, and the airplane stopped rolling at 144 degrees right wing down. At 15:57:48, as the airplane began rolling left, back towards wings level, the airspeed increased through 260 knots, the pitch attitude decreased through 60 degrees nose down, normal acceleration fluctuated between 2.0 and 2.5 G, and the altitude decreased through 6,000 feet. At 15:57:51, as the roll attitude passed through 90 degrees, continuing towards wings level, the captain applied more than 22 pounds of nose-up control column force, the elevator position increased to about 3 degrees nose up, pitch attitude stopped decreasing at 73 degrees nose down, the airspeed increased through 300 KIAS, normal acceleration remained above 2 G, and the altitude decreased through 4,900 feet. At 15:57:53, as the captain's nose-up control column force decreased below 22 pounds, the first officer's nose-up control column force again exceeded 22 pounds and the captain made the statement ""nice and easy."" At 15:57:55, the normal acceleration increased to over 3.0 G. Approximately 1.7 seconds later, as the altitude decreased through 1,700 feet, the elevator position and vertical acceleration began to increase rapidly. The last recorded data on the FDR occurred at an altitude of 1,682 feet (vertical speed of approximately 500 feet per second), and indicated that the airplane was at an airspeed of 375 KIAS, a pitch attitude of 38 degrees nose down with 5 degrees of nose-up elevator, and was experiencing a vertical acceleration of 3.6 G. The airplane impacted a wet soybean field partially inverted, in a nose down, left-wing-low attitude.
Based on petitions filed for reconsideration of the probable cause, the NTSB on September 2002 updated its findings.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The loss of control, attributed to a sudden and unexpected aileron hinge moment reversal, that occurred after a ridge of ice accreted beyond the deice boots while the airplane was in a holding pattern during which it intermittently encountered supercooled cloud and drizzle/rain drops, the size and water content of which exceeded those described in the icing certification envelope. The airplane was susceptible to this loss of control, and the crew was unable to recover.
Contributing to the accident were
1) the French Directorate General for Civil Aviation's (DGAC's) inadequate oversight of the ATR 42 and 72, and its failure to take the necessary corrective action to ensure continued airworthiness in icing conditions;
2) the DGAC's failure to provide the FAA with timely airworthiness information developed from previous ATR incidents and accidents in icing conditions,
3) the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) failure to ensure that aircraft icing certification requirements, operational requirements for flight into icing conditions, and FAA published aircraft icing information adequately accounted for the hazards that can result from flight in freezing rain,
4) the FAA's inadequate oversight of the ATR 42 and 72 to ensure continued airworthiness in icing conditions; and
5) ATR's inadequate response to the continued occurrence of ATR 42 icing/roll upsets which, in conjunction with information learned about aileron control difficulties during the certification and development of the ATR 42 and 72, should have prompted additional research, and the creation of updated airplane flight manuals, flightcrew operating manuals and training programs related to operation of the ATR 42 and 72 in such icing conditions.

After a flight from Penghu Island the ATR-72 the aircraft was cleared by Taipei Tower for a visual approach to runway 10.
The aircraft descended until it impacted a wooded hillside at an altitude of 300 m. At that point during the approach the aircraft should have been at 640-770 m.

Causes of the Incident
The investigation team identified the following factors as a combination of circumstances leading to the incident:
- Poor coordination between the captain and the first officer.
- During the Lunar New Year holiday period, the flight crew engaged in casual conversation without passengers onboard, gradually losing their situational awareness of the environment.
- The flight crew may not have maintained adequate situational awareness during the flight, failing to recognize proximity to the ground.
- The ILS (Instrument Landing System) received false signals, but the flight crew did not use other navigational aids for verification and distinction."

While climbing through 7500 feet, the fire warning system activated. The flight crew extinguished the fire, secured the engine, and returned to the departure airport. Examination of the engine revealed that a fuel leak had occurred at the #7 and #8 fuel manifold nozzle transfer tubes. The fuel manifold transfer tube locking plates for the #7 and #8 nozzle assemblies were found improperly installed, and the respective 'O' rings were found to be cut and scratched. Also, the engine's overboard (fuel/oil) drain line was found to be about 99% blocked with a carbon-like material. Additionally, the engine's fuel manifold and turbine support case drain lines were noted to be positioned directly opposite each other within the drain manifold. The drain line's turbine support case fitting had an oversized and offset, crush gasket. The nacelle's interior had a flame discolored area directly below this fitting.

Probable Cause: improper installation of the #7 and #8 fuel nozzle manifold transfer tubes by company maintenance personnel, and an inadequate exhaust drain fitting gasket, which resulted in fuel leaks at the respective 'O' ring/gasket fittings; blockage of the fuel/oil drain manifold; and subsequent fire in the engine compartment.

The crew was informed by company maintenance personnel that they might be experiencing a possible fuel nozzle leak on that engine. The #1 engine fire warning light illuminated, and the fire horn activated. The captain secured the engine and discharged the #1 fire suppression agent. Immediately following the discharge, the associated warning lights on the fire handle and condition lever extinguished. An uneventful single engine landing was completed and the passengers deplaned without further incident. Evidence of thermal damage was found in the aft section of the engine in the area of the lower turbine support case. Examination of the system revealed that 3 of the 144 'O' rings associated with the 14-nozzle fuel system were deteriorated or damaged. Also, during the investigation, testing at the engine manufacturer's facility revealed that the inside diameter of the copper gasket used at the fuel drain nipple was 30 to 40% larger than required. This resulted in misalignment and a leak at the fitting.

Probable Cause: 'O' ring failure in the fuel line to the left engine nozzle assemblies, which resulted in a fuel line leak and a left engine compartment fire.

The smoke drill was actioned by the crew and, during the descent, the fumes dissipated and the aircraft landed safely. Subsequent engineering inspection of the air conditioning system failed to find any evidence of oil ingress, burning or smoke damage. Since level 2 anti-icing had been in use at the time of the incident, the engines were ground run at 80% torque for some 2 minutes. However, no signs of overheating or smoke were observed
and the aircraft was therefore released back to service, with no attendant recurrence of the fault.
However, on 16 February 1997 the aircraft was returning from Dublin to London Gatwick when traces of smoke, accompanied by pungent fumes, again appeared on the flight deck. At about this time, the cabin staff reported that there was smoke in the centre area of the cabin, around seat row 6, and that the cabin walls in this area were 'hot'. The commander declared an emergency and diverted into Liverpool. After subsequent inspection the aircraft was cleared for a flight to Gatwick Airport where more detailed engineering checks could be carried out. Following arrival at Gatwick a problem was identified with the No 1 air conditioning recirculation fan/control circuit where a
relay, positioned beneath row 6 in the passenger cabin, was found to show evidence of electrical arcing and overheating. Overheating damage was also evident on the cabin air recirculation fan motor. This unit was removed from the aircraft and sent to the manufacturer for inspection and rectification, and a report has been requested by the AAIB.

Hobby Airport, TX (HOU/KHOU)",(KDFW),"The ATR-72-12 transport airplane was at 5,000 feet MSL when the #2 engine fire warning light illuminated. After shutting down the #2 engine and actuating the fire extinguishing system, the crew executed a single engine landing followed by a normal taxi to the ramp and normal passenger debarkation. Inspection of the P&W 127 series engine showed that a fuel transfer tube adjacent to the #2 nozzle was misaligned and 'backed out' of its retaining clip. Fuel streaking and fire damage were evident down the right side of the engine from the #2 nozzle downward along the fuel nozzle ring assembly. The incident occurred 3.4 hours after the fuel nozzles, retaining clips, and transfer tubes were replaced during maintenance on the #2 engine. The engine manufacturer had published several service bulletins addressing the potential of incorrectly installing the retaining clips and recommending that existing clips be replaced with stronger lock plates that provide a positive locking mechanism to avoid misalignment during installation. The manufacturer issued a Service Bulletin in October 1994 and Transport Canada issued an AD in November 1996, both citing how the retaining clips could be installed 'out of position' and recommending that operators use the newer lock plate. The FAA had published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on July 17, 1995, addressing the aforementioned issues. FAA AD 98-14-02 was published in the Federal Register on July 1, 1998. The AD was similar to the Canadian AD issued on November 19, 1996.

Probable Cause: the engine fire during descent resulting from a loose, leaking fuel transfer tube due to improper installation and alignment of the transfer tube's retaining clip. Contributing factors were the inadequate design of the clamp, the failure of the operator to comply with the recommendations of the manufacturer's Service Bulletin (SB), and the failure of the FAA to issue an Airworthiness Directive to mandate the manufacturer's SB.

Their first scheduled sector was an 1120 hrs departure
for Cork, returning to Gatwick at 1515 hrs. This was to be followed by a 1545 hrs departure for
Jersey, returning to Gatwick at 1815 hrs. For operational reasons the first sector was changed to an
1140 hrs departure for Amsterdam, returning to Gatwick at 1450 hrs. The late arrival of some of the
passengers delayed departure until 1320 hrs; the aircraft arrived back at Gatwick at 1640 hrs.
The aircraft eventually took off at 1740 hrs for Jersey; the first officer was the handling pilot. The
flight progressed normally and the aircraft was transferred to Jersey Zone control at 1801 hrs. At
that time the RVR on Runway 09 was greater than 1,500 metres. The aircraft was transferred to
Jersey Approach control at 1808 hrs and was given radar vectors for the ILS approach to
Runway 09.

By 1811 hrs the RVR had reduced to 750 metres at touchdown, 600 metres at midpoint and 650
metres at the stop end; the required minima was 800 metres. The commander decided to hold at the
'JW'. Before the aircraft reached the beacon, there was a temporary improvement to 800 metres but
no sooner had the commander decided to make an approach than it deteriorated to 550 metres. The
aircraft continued towards the 'JW' and descended to 3,000 feet.

At 1818 hrs the RVR increased to 900 metres and once again the commander decided to attempt an
approach. The crew reported that they could see most of the island except for the area around the
airport. At 1820 hrs, the RVR reduced to 350 metres. The approach was discontinued from the
downwind position and the aircraft entered the hold at SHARK at 2,000 feet.

The RVR remained constant at 400 metres for some time and, at 1831 hrs, the commander told
ATC that he could hold for a further 15 minutes before having to return to Gatwick. He then
requested the RVR on Runway 27; this was 1,500 metres at touchdown, 450 metres at midpoint and
400 metres at the stop end. He decided to make an approach to Runway 27, however, the RVR
reduced to 600 metres, the minima for Runway 27. It deteriorated further to 350 metres but then
improved to 1,500 metres. The commander decided to continue the approach but by the time the
aircraft had reached the base leg, the RVR had reduced to 400 metres. The approach was
discontinued and the aircraft headed towards the 'JSY' VOR to take up the hold. The commander
made the decision to divert to Gatwick at 1847 hrs; he reported that the fuel remaining at that time
was 1,160 lb.

The commander called London Area Control at 1900 hrs and was told there were delays of 30 to
35 minutes at Gatwick; he was given a direct routing to Goodwood and told to expect a WILLO 3C
arrival. The commander acknowledged this and requested ""---- A PRIORITY LANDING AS WE'VE
BEEN HOLDING DOWN AT JERSEY----"". The controller asked how much holding fuel he had and was
told about 15 minutes.

At 1903 hrs, the controller advised the commander that he would be asked on the next frequency if
he was declaring an emergency. He explained that it was the only way ATC would be able to give
him a priority approach. The commander then told ATC that he would be able to hold for about 5
minutes. He confirmed that he would be declaring an emergency and the controller suggested that
he ""MIGHT AS WELL DECLARE YOUR EMERGENCY NOW"". The commander confirmed this at 1905
hrs and was subsequently told that he would be given radar vectors for a WILLO 3C arrival
followed by a straight in approach.

The first officer expressed his reservations about the commander's decision to declare an
emergency in order to continue the diversion to Gatwick; he considered that Southampton was the
preferred option as the weather was better and it was not fuel critical. He continued to express his
reservations even after the commander had made his decision.

At 1920 hrs, the commander called Gatwick Director and reported that they were descending to
FL70 on course to Goodwood.

Over the next two minutes the following transmissions were exchanged between the commander and ATC:

Aircraft ""----HOW ARE YOUR QUEUES NOW WE BY DECLARING AN EMERGENCY WE WERE TOLD WE WOULDN'T BE DELAYED WE COULD HOLD FOR TEN MINUTES OR SO AND CANCEL THE EMERGENCY IF THE DELAYS WERE ONLY TEN MINUTES OR SO"".

Controller ""--- THEY'RE STILL IN EXCESS OF TWENTY MINUTES"".

Aircraft ""---OH STILL IN EXCESS OF TWENTY MINUTES"".

Controller â€œ---YOU WISH TO CONFIRM THAT YOUR EMERGENCY STILL EXISTS"".

Aircraft ""----IT LOOKS AS IF WE REALLY OUGHT TO GO TO SOUTHAMPTON AND NOT DECLARE THE EMERGENCY ORIGINALLY WE WERE TOLD HALF AN HOUR WHICH WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US AND WE DON'T REALLY WANT TO DECLARE AN EMERGENCY ALTHOUGH IT'S A BIT LATE FOR THAT NOW"".

Shortly after this the commander spoke to the Company Operations. The first officer monitored this
conversation which initially went normally but then he became aware that the commander was not
responding. He reported that when he looked across at the commander, he was slumped in his seat,
his head was down and his eyes appeared to be ""unfocused"". There were beads of sweat starting to
appear on his forehead. The first officer talked to him and shook his arm, however, he got no
response.

Just before 1926 hrs the first officer made the following transmission:

""---WE DO DEFINITELY WANT TO CONTINUE TO GATWICK NOW MY SKIPPER IS NOT THAT WELL CURRENTLY I'LL KEEP YOU INFORMED I THINK HE'S STILL WITH ME""

At about 1927 hrs, the commander appeared to suddenly recover from his incapacitation. Initially,
he was very animated and after a short period of confusion he continued in the role of non-handling
pilot. The crew executed a standard Category 2 approach; the commander took control at decision
height and carried out a normal landing. The aircraft was on the ground at 1938 hrs.

A Local Standby had been initiated by ATC. The AFS attended the aircraft and followed it to the
stand. The commander had apparently fully recovered and declined to be examined by the
paramedics who attended; both crew members were interviewed by Airport Police before they left
the stand area.

Both aircraft were parked adjacent to the terminal building at Norwich. The B737, parked on Stand 2, was cleared by ATC to taxi for departure. The commander of the B737 stated that he was given the 'all clear' from the ground engineer and increased thrust from idle to 30% to 35% N1. This thrust setting was insufficient to move the aircraft so power was increased to 35% to 40% N1. After approximately 50 metres of travel the ground engineer signalled the commander to stop. A strip of tarmac, peeled from the apron surface, had become attached to the aircraft's nosewheel tyre. This
was removed, the remaining landing gear was examined and the aircraft continued to taxi.
The commander of the ATR 72, parked on Stand 3, stated that, as the B737 taxiied from the apron a wooden board was dislodged from a nearby baggage truck by the jet blast and struck and damaged the fin of his aircraft. The commander of the B737 was not aware of this incident as he continued to taxi.

The crew could not locate the traffic, because at the time they were flying in instrument meteorological conditions. About 3 minutes later the crew received a TCAS (traffic collision avoidance system) alert to climb. The flight climbed from 4,000 feet and leveled off at 5,300 feet. During the climb both flight attendants fell. One flight attendant broke her leg, the other was not injured. The flight attendants were standing completing their pre-landing duties when the event occurred. The pilot radioed ATC that he needed to have an ambulance meet the flight when it landed. The flight landed without further incident, and the flight attendant was taken to a local hospital.

Probable Cause: an abrupt maneuver in response to a traffic avoidance system alert, resulting in a flight attendant falling and breaking a leg.

The ATR 72 had descended early and was joining Queenstown under visual flight rules via Kawarau Gorge at low-level in poor weather. Before entering the gorge, the ATR 72 had been advised by air traffic control of a possible requirement to hold at a reporting point on the edge of the control zone. Committed to continue flying through the gorge in deteriorating weather, the ATR 72 was unable to hold at the reporting point when later instructed to. The crew of the ATR 72 had continued through the gorge in the belief that they did not need to obtain an entry clearance into the control zone.

Having entered the control zone the ATR 72 compromised the circling approach of the Boeing 737 that was operating in accordance with normal instrument flight rules procedures. The controller was initially unsure of the location and intended flight path of the Boeing 737, and when both aircraft were established in the zone he was left with little option than to position the ATR 72 in front of the Boeing 737. The captain of the Boeing 737 was then committed to continuing towards the aerodrome in reducing visibility because the ATR 72 had obstructed its primary escape route to the south of the aerodrome.

Safety issues identified were:
* the ATR 72 entering a control zone without an entry clearance
* safety procedures for flying through Kawarau Gorge
* a general poor industry understanding of the requirements for flight under special visual flight rules
* position reporting by aircraft after becoming visual on the instrument approach
* flight under visual flight rules by medium and large air transport aircraft
* poor industry understanding of the management of general aviation areas within the Queenstown Control Zone.

The aircraft received a hard jolt followed by moderate turbulence that caused an unseated cabin crewmember to lose her footing and fall against a seat armrest. She sustained a fracture of the great right toe and the left ankle.

Probable Cause: The flight attendant's failure to seat and belt herself during an inflight encounter with turbulence in clouds resulting in her losing foothold and falling against a passenger seat, sustaining a fractured ankle.

Hartsfield International Airport, GA (ATL/KATL)",(KAVL),"At 10,000 feet msl, while maneuvering for landing, the flight encountered an area of moderate turbulence. The seat belt sign was 'ON' and the flight attendants were performing pre-landing duties. One of the flight attendants broke a bone during the turbulence event. The captain was not informed about the injured flight attendant until he walked to the back of the aircraft after arriving at the gate. According to the injured flight attendant (F/A-A), she was briefed '...only [that it]...would be a little rough getting out of Atlanta, but once we got up everything would be ok...no warning from the cockpit at all of rough air/turbulence' Both flight attendants were knocked to the floor to a sitting position, and both said the turbulence didn't stop. The injured flight attendant said, 'I...was knocked to the floor over and over...up into the service door and the passenger door; my head hit the steps and ended up on the floor flat down...I stayed on the floor...no bells were given when the aircraft was descending...the only 4 bells I heard was at landing time. Also no announcements from [the] cockpit was made when descending through 10,000 feet to the passengers because we were in 0.75 moderate turbulence at the time.' SIGMET [significant metrological] November 2, and AIRMET (Airmen Meteorological Information Network) Tango update 3, calling for a large area of moderate turbulence below 12,000 feet, were current and applicable to the flight's descent into Ashville. The company verified that both the SIGMET and AIRMET were part of the captain's weather briefing, and he had them both in his possession before departure.

Probable Cause: the flight encountered forecasted turbulence, which resulted in serious injury to a flight attendant. Factors in this accident were; the captain's inadequate briefing to the cabin crew; and the insufficient information about the known turbulence that would be encountered during descent.

At 20:33, the crew received clearance for takeoff on runway 22 from the air traffic control (Tower), with a wind report of 190 degrees at 1 knot. The weather was good, with no visibility issues during the dark night. The runway was dry.
During the takeoff roll, at the decision speed (V1), the crew felt two to three hard strikes against the nose gear. After a normal gear retraction, the crew checked all aircraft systems and found no deviations. The flight continued to the destination airport.
The pilot in command (PIC) informed the tower that the aircraft had apparently collided with an object on the runway during the takeoff roll.
A subsequent runway inspection revealed that three lights of the left runway edge lighting were destroyed.

The aircraft was carrying a cargo of fabric, leather, and electronic materials. At 01:51 the co-pilot contacted Taipei Control and requested permission to descend from FL180 to FL160. At 01:52:10, at an altitude of 17,853 feet, a stall warning sounded and the stick shaker activated. The crew disconnected the autopilot and tried maintain control of the airplane. Sixteen seconds later the aircraft descended through 14,465 feet. Within seven seconds the aircraft had descended through 10,246 feet at a speed of 320 knots. At 01:52:47 the plane passed an altitude of 3,027 feet. Three seconds later the cockpit voice recorder stopped working. The aircraft crashed into the sea.

FINDINGS RELATED TO PROBABLE CAUSES:
1. The accident flight encountered severe icing conditions. The liquid water content and maximum droplet size were beyond the icing certification envelope of FAR/JAR 25 appendix C.
2. TNA's training and rating of aircraft severe icing for this pilots has not been effective and the pilots have not developed a familiarity with the Note, CAUTION and WARNING set forth in Flight Crew Operating Manual and Airplane Flight Manual to adequately perform their duties.
3. After the flight crew detected icing condition and the airframe de-icing system was activated twice, the flight crew did not read the relative Handbook, thereby the procedure was not able to inform the flight crew and to remind them of ""be alert to severe icing detection"".
4. The ""unexpected decrease in speed"" indicated by the airspeed indicator is an indication of severe icing.
5. The flight crew did not respond to the severe Icing conditions with pertinent alertness and situation awareness that the aircraft might have encountered conditions which was ""outside that for which the aircraft was certificated and might seriously degrade the performance and controllability of the aircraft"".
6. The flight crew was too late in detecting the severe icing conditions. After detection, they did not change altitude immediately, nor take other steps required in the Severe Icing Emergency Procedures.
7. The aircraft was in an ""unusual or uncontrolled rolling and pitching"" state, and a stall occurred thereafter.
8. After the aircraft had developed a stall and an abnormal attitude, the recovery maneuvering did not comply with the operating procedures and techniques for Recovery of Unusual Attitudes. The performance and controllability of the aircraft may have been seriously degraded by then. It cannot be confirmed whether the unusual attitudes of the aircraft could have been recovered if the crew's operation had complied with the relevant procedures and techniques.
9. During the first 25 minutes, the extra drag increased about 100 counts, inducing a speed diminishing about 10 knots.
10. During the airframe de-icing system was intermittently switched off, it is highly probable that residual ice covered on the wings of the aircraft.
11. Four minutes prior to autopilot disengaged, the extra drag increased about 500 counts, and airspeed decayed to 158 knots, and lift-drag ratio loss about 64% rapidly.
12. During the 10s before the roll upset, the longitudinal and lateral stability has been modified by the severe ice accumulated on the wings producing the flow separation. Before autopilot disengaged, the aerodynamic of the aircraft (lift/drag) was degraded of about 40%.

The captain was the nonflying pilot for the flight, and the first officer was the flying pilot. The takeoff, climb, and en route portions of the flight were uneventful. At 14:37, as the flight approached the San Juan traffic area, the ATIS reported that winds were 060 degrees at 17 knots and gusting at 23 knots. Shortly thereafter, the captain briefed a Vref (the minimum approach airspeed in the landing configuration before the airplane reaches the runway threshold) of 95 knots and told the first officer to ""stand by for winds."" At 14:43 SJU Terminal Radar Approach Control cautioned the pilots of possible wake turbulence from a preceding Boeing. The captain told the first officer to slow down to about 140 kts. At 14:46, the local controller cleared the airplane to land on runway 08. The first officer turned the airplane left toward runway 08 and transitioned to the visual approach slope indicator. At 14:49, the captain stated, ""you better keep that nose down or get some power up because you're gonna balloon."" The airplane descended below the glideslope, causing a GPWS ""glideslope"" alert. The airplane was about 45 feet above ground level and traveling at 110 knots indicated airspeed when it crossed the runway 08 threshold. After the airplane crossed the runway threshold, the captain stated, ""power in a little bit, don't pull the nose up, don't pull the nose up."" At 14:49:39, the captain stated, ""you're ballooning,"" and the first officer replied, ""all right.""
The airplane touched down for the first time about 14:49:41 and about 1,600 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold with vertical and lateral loads of about 1.3 Gs and -0.10 G, respectively. Upon touchdown the captain stated, ""get the power,"" and, 1 second later, ""my aircraft."" The first officer responded, ""your airplane."" The airplane had skipped to an altitude of about 4 feet and touched down again two seconds later about 2,200 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold. The airplane then pitched up to an angle of 9Â° while climbing to an altitude of 37 feet and the engine torque increased from 10 to 43 percent. About 14:49:49, the pitch angle decreased to -3Â°, and the engine torque started to decrease to 20 percent with the pitch angle decreasing to -10Â°. The airplane touched down a third time about 14:49:51 at a bank angle of 7Â° left wing down and about 3,300 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold and with vertical and lateral loads of about 5 Gs and 0.85 G. The ATR pitched up again to 24 feet and landed a fourth time about 14:49:56 (about 15 seconds after the initial touchdown) and about 4,000 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold. This time the airplane pitched down to -7Â° and that it was banked 29Â° left wing down. The airplane came to a complete stop on a grassy area about 217 feet left of the runway centerline and about 4,317 feet beyond the runway threshold.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the captainÂ’s failure to execute proper techniques to recover from the bounced landings and his subsequent failure to execute a go-around.""

6 Aug 2005,ATR 72-202,TS-LBB,Tuninter,16,26 km NE off Palermo-Punta Raisi Airport (PMO),w/o,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/322358,ATR 72 (all series),_AT72,15:40,258,P&W Canada PW124B,Fatalities: 16 / Occupants: 39,0,Accident,En route,Passenger - Non-Scheduled/charter/Air Taxi,Bari Karol Wojtyla Airport (BRI/LIBD),Djerba-Melita Airport (DJE/DTTJ),"Tuninter flight 1153, an ATR 72-202, crashed into the sea after a los of engine power due to fuel exhaustion, killing 16 occupants; 23 survived the accident.

On August 5, 2005 Tuninter's ATR-72 TS-LBB arrived at Tunis Airport with 790 kg of fuel left in the fuel tanks. During maintenance the Fuel Quantity Indicator (FQI) was changed. Erroneously the FQI for ATR-42 aircraft was installed. The normal operation of the FQI is to processes the signal coming from the capacitance probes installed in the tanks with an algorithm typical for each aircraft, depending on tank shape, size and number of probes installed. The indication of the amount of fuel on board the airplane now read 3050 kg instead of 790 kg.
On August 6 the airplane was prepared for flight 152F to Bari. An amount of 465 kg fuel was added for the flight (total fuel: 1255 kg, with 3800 kg indicated). Upon landing at Bari only 305 kg were left in the tanks. Normally this should have triggered a 'LO LVL' warning, but the FQI read 2300 kg, which made the crew believe they had plenty of fuel left. In preparation for the flight to Djerba, just 265 kg of fuel was added. The flight departed with 2700 kg of fuel indicated by the FQI (actual amount: 570 kg).
En route, at 15:24 the crew contacted Palermo for an emergency landing. They had run out of fuel and both engines had quit. Their FQI nevertheless showed 1800 kg of fuel. They did not make it to Palermo and ditched in the sea around 15:40.

CAUSE AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS:

The accident under examination, as most aviation accidents, has been determined by a series of events linked one another, which caused the final ditching. The ditching was primarly due to the both engines flame out because of fuel exhaustion.
The incorrect replacement of the fuel quantity indicator (FQI) was one of the contributing factors which led irremediably to the accident.
The accident's cause is therefore traceable firstly to the incorrect procedure used for replacing the FQI, by means of the operator's maintenance personnel. This shall be considered the disruptive element, which caused the final ditching of the aircraft due to the lack of fuel that caused the shutdown of both engines.
As said before the accident was determined by a series of events (contributing factors) linked one another. Hereafter are listed some considered of major importance.
- Errors committed by ground mechanics when searching for and correctly identifying the fuel indicator.
- Errors committed by the flight crew: non-respect of various operational procedures.
- Inadequate checks by the competent office of the operator that flight crew were respecting operational procedures.
- Inaccuracy of the information entered in the aircraft management and spares information system and the absence of an effective control of the system itself.
- Inadequate training for aircraft management and spares information system use and absence of a responsible person appointed for managing the system itself.
- Maintenance and organization standards of the operator unsatisfactory for an adequate aircraft management.
- Lack of an adequate quality assurance system;
- Inadequate surveillance of the operator by the competent Tunisian authority.
- Installation characteristics of fuel quantity indicators (FQI) for ATR 42 and ATR 72 which made it possible to install an ATR 42 type FQI in an ATR 72, and viceversa.

The analysis of various factors that contributed to the event has been carried out according to the so called ReasonÂ’s ""Organizational accident"" model. Active failures, which had triggered the accident, are those committed both by ground mechanics/technicians the day before the event while searching for and replacing the fuel quantity indicator, and by the crew who did not verify and fully and accurately complete the aircraftÂ’s documentation, through which it would have been possible to perceive an anomalous situation regarding the quantity of fuel onboard.
Latent failures, however, remained concealed, latent in the operator's organizational system until, some active errors (by mechanics and pilots) were made, overcoming the system's defence barriers, causing the accident.
Analysing latent and active failures (errors) traceable to various parties, involved in the event in several respects, it clearly emerges that they were operating in a potentially deceptive organizational system. When latent failures remain within a system without being identified and eliminated, the possibility of mutual interaction increases, making the system susceptible for active failures, or not allowing the system to prevent them, in case of errors. Active failures were inserted in a context characterised by organizational and maintenance deficiencies.
The error that led to the accident was committed by mechanics who searched for and replaced the FQI, but this error occurred in an organizational setting in which, if everybody were operating correctly, probably the accident would not have occurred.
Inaccuracy of information entered in the aircraft management and spares information system, particularly regarding the interchangeability of items and the absence of an effective control of the system itself, has been considered in fact one of the latent failures that contributed to the event. The maintenance and organization standards of the operator, at the time of event, were not considered satisfactory for an adequate management of the aircraft.
The flight crew and maintenance mechanics/technicians involved in the event,

The approach was de-stabilised and the aircraft landed heavily and bounced, during which the lower rear fuselage struck the runway, causing substantial damage. The investigation identified that the landing technique employed was incorrect and that the runway length was more than adequate for the aircraft to make a normal landing in the prevailing conditions.

On board were 47 passengers and 2 cabin crew, and 2 pilots and a maintenance engineer on the flight deck. There were no injuries, and no damage to the aeroplane.

Shortly after the captain had landed the aeroplane it was struck by a strong gust, which weathercocked the aeroplane forcefully towards the runway edge. The gust probably exceeded the aeroplane crosswind limit and prevented the captain correcting the weathercock. Consequently, the aeroplane went onto the grass area beside the runway, where it paralleled the runway for about 630 metres before re-entering the runway.

A contributing factor was the reduced effectiveness of the nose wheel steering, because the first officer had not moved the control column far enough forward to ensure there was sufficient weight on the nose wheels.

There were no casualties.
The airplane landed nose-first and porpoised, causing a hard landing on the nose gear followed by nose landing gear collapse.

Probable Causes:
The accident occurred due to an excessive landing speed due to inadequate power control. The aircraft touched down with a negative pitch attitude and porpoised. The crew then used excessive downward elevator, causing aircraft to touch down with a vertical speed that exceeded the design limits of the front landing gear.

The second leg of the flight was uneventful until the final approach. The aircraft bounced on landing, causing the pilot to add power in an attempt to cushion the sink rate. However the aircraft landed hard and bounced again. This was followed with a series of bounces, during which the aircraft migrated from the runway and finally came to full halt on right side close to airport boundary wall. There was no fire.

The Indore runway is 7480 feet (2280 m) long.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The Pilot-in-Command in absence of bounce recovery guidance adopted self-perceived technique and kept on adding engine power along with aircraft Pitch manipulations to salvage the aircraft from the bounce on landing, and gravely damaged the aircraft structure."""

At 19:54 hours local time the ATR was stationary at taxi hold point B12 when it was given clearance to enter runway 26L. The clearance was given immediately after an Airbus A320 had commenced its takeoff run on runway 26L. Twenty seconds later, the ATR was cleared for takeoff from runway 26L and confirmed receipt of the message.
Forty seconds later the tower asked the ATR to begin the takeoff run, because otherwise another aircraft then on approach would have to go around. The ATR confirmed the immediate commencement of the takeoff run. Six seconds later the tower instructed the ATR to abort the takeoff: ""[Call sign] disregard departure clearance vacate first high-speed to the right again."" The ATR followed the instruction and was then cleared via taxiway T to return to taxi hold point B14 for runway 26L.
On arrival at hold point B14, the crew noted that the brake temperature indicated was excessive. At 20:02 hrs the tower asked the ATR crew if they were ready for an immediate takeoff, to which they replied in the negative. Seventy seconds later the crew of another aircraft reported by radio: ""[...] Air Dolomiti you are on fire at B14 your left tyre is on fire."" A few seconds later the tower gave the alarm and 59 passengers and four crew members left the aircraft via the rear left door and the front left emergency exit. The fire service reached the aircraft shortly thereafter and extinguished the fire, which by then had spread from the tyre to the undercarriage fairing.
During the evacuation, one female passenger broke her left forearm.

Examination of the left landing gear showed that a brake cylinder on the inner wheel of the left landing gear had ruptured. Two others had been deformed. A thermal analysis determined that normal taxiing to the runway, rejected takeoff, and the taxiing back to the taxi hold point could not heat up the brake to an extent which would cause the found damages.

PROBABLE CAUSE: The investigation report did not contain a probable cause paragraph as recommended in ICAO Annex 13.

Following an uneventful flight, the aircraft came to a halt on stand and the crew applied the parking brake. However, the aircraft subsequently started to move forward once more and, despite attempts to stop the aircraft by using the brakes, it continued to move until it struck a stand guidance mirror assembly. The investigation determined that a failure of a hydraulic fuse in the parking/emergency brake line had led to a loss of the brake accumulator hydraulic pressure. The aircraft suffered substantial damage to one of its propellers. The Guidance Mirror Assembly was also substantially damaged.

Runway 27 thus was available only after runway intersection as runway 27A. To carry out operations on this reduced runway 27 a NOTAM was issued and designated runway 27A for visual approach only.
The weather conditions prevailing at the time of accident was winds 070/07 knots visibility 2800 m with feeble rain. Prior to Kingfisher aircraft, Air India flight IC-164, an Airbus 319 had landed and reported to ATC that it had aquaplaned and broken two runway edge lights. The ATC acknowledged it and sent runway inspection vehicle to inspect the runway. The ATC person was not familiar with the terminology of 'aquaplaning' and not realizing the seriousness of it, cleared the Kingfisher flight for landing. At the time of accident there were water patches on the runway. ATC also did not transmit to the Kingfisher aircraft the information regarding aquaplaning reported by the previous aircraft.
The ATR-72 approached high and fast. The aircraft landed late on the runway and the runway length available was around 1000 m from the touchdown point. In the prevailing weather conditions this runway length was just sufficient to stop the aircraft on the runway. During landing the aircraft aquaplaned and did not decelerate even though reversers and full manual braking was applied by both the cockpit crew. The aircraft started skidding toward the left of center line. On nearing the runway end, the pilot initiated a 45Â° right turn, after crossing Taxiway N10, the aircraft rolled into an unpaved wet area. It rolled over drainage pipes and finally came to a stop near open drain. There was no fire.

PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT:
The accident occurred due to unstabilized approach and decision of crew not to carry out a 'Go-around'.
Contributory Factors:
i) Water patches on the R/w 27A
ii) Inability of the ATCO to communicate the aircraft about aquaplaning of the previous aircraft
iii) Lack of input from the co-pilot.

After running checklist procedures without success, the flight crew slowed the airplane to 180 knots and were able to regain full control of the elevator. On final approach and after configuring for landing, the elevators again seemed to be jammed. The flight crew conducted a go-around and declared an emergency. During the second approach, with both control columns partially jammed, the flight crew performed a shallow approach to a smooth landing. A postincident examination revealed that brackets holding an elevator stop had fractured, causing the elevator movement to partially jam. The fractures were consistent with fatigue failure and were caused by a combination of improperly installed shim stacks, poor alignment of the L-brackets, and cyclic stresses acting on the lower stop, which were generated by the repeated improper use of the gust lock system.

Probable Cause: A fatigue failure of an elevator stop bracket, which resulted in a partial jam of the elevator control. Contributing to the failure was the improper installation of shim stacks, poor alignment of the brackets, and cyclic stresses acting on the lower stop, generated by the repeated improper use of the gust lock system.

Approximately 35 minutes later, another ATR 72 aeroplane, also flying from Christchurch to Wellington, encountered severe turbulence in the same general area.
Although no injuries or damage resulted from these incidents, the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) decided to inquire into the adequacy of the meteorological information available to the pilots before and during the flights, the operator and flight crew action taken to minimise the risks of severe turbulence encounters, and the processes followed by the providers of air traffic and meteorological services in response to pilot reports of significant weather hazards.
The investigation found that the events might have been avoided or been less severe had the operator had a more robust flight dispatch system, and had the air traffic service complied fully with a requirement to pass flight information to pilots on first contact.

Rohlsen Airport (STX/TISX),Saint Croix-Henry E. Rohlsen Airport (STX/TISX),"During takeoff the No. 1 (left) engine fire warning illuminated in the cockpit. The pilot declared an emergency, shut down the No. 1 engine and discharged one fire bottle. The fire warning continued and the pilot discharged the second bottle; but the fire warning did not extinguish. The pilot performed an air turnback and landed the airplane uneventfully approximately 11 minutes later.

Engine testing at the manufacturer's facility revealed a large fuel leak emanating from the No. 2 fuel nozzle manifold adapter-to-transfer tube O-ring connection.

Examination revealed two manufacturing defects in the No. 2 fuel nozzle manifold adapter. The first defect, poor surface finish, caused damage to the transfer tube O-ring during the installation process, initiating an internal fuel leak. The second defect, blockage of the internal safety tell-tale drain due to an improper machining and subsequent cleaning procedure, prevented the leaking fuel from flowing into the tell-tale drain and being detected by maintenance personnel.

Examination of the transfer tubes revealed an undersized O-ring retention zone, which allowed the O-ring to fit loosely such that it was not capable of withstanding continuous maximum fuel pressure load. Eventually the O-ring failed to seal properly, fuel leaked and was ignited by the hot combustor case. The undersized O-ring retention zone was created during the cleaning and overhaul process of the transfer tube.

Probable Cause: The sealing failure between the fuel nozzle adapter assembly and fuel transfer tubes that allowed fuel to leak into the nacelle fire zone where it was subsequently ignited by the hot combustor case. Contributing to the failure was a combination of manufacturing defects of the fuel nozzle adapter assembly by the manufacturer and incorrectly overhauled fuel transfer tubes by the engine manufacturer. Contributing to the incident was a second defect of the fuel nozzle adapter assembly by the manufacturer which prevented maintenance personnel from detecting the internal fuel leak.

The first officer was the Pilot Flying (PF) while the captain was the Pilot Not Flying (PNF).
Approaching Manila, the flight was under radar vector for a VOR/DME approach to runway 24. At 7 miles on finals the approach was stabilized. A sudden tailwind was experienced by the crew at 500 feet radio altitude (RA) which resulted in an increase in airspeed and vertical speed. The captain took over the controls and continued the approach. Suddenly, the visibility went to zero and consequently the aircraft experienced a bounced landing three times, before a go-around was initiated. During climb out the crew noticed cockpit instruments were affected including both transponders and landing gears. They requested for a priority landing and were vectored and cleared to land on runway 13. After landing the aircraft was taxied to F4 where normal deplaning was carried out. No injuries were reported on the crew and passengers.

PROBABLE CAUSE
The Aircraft Accident Investigation and Inquiry Board determined that the probable cause of this accident was:
- Primary Cause Factor
Failure of the flight crew to discontinue the approach when deteriorating weather and their associated hazards to flight operations had moved into the airport (Human Factor)
- Contributory Factor
The adverse weather condition affected the judgment and decision-making of the PIC even prior to the approach to land. With poor weather conditions being encountered, the PIC still continued the approach and landing. (Environmental Factor)
- Underlying Factor
As a result of the bounced landing, several cockpit instruments were affected including both transponders on board. One of the nosewheels was detached and all the landing gears could not be retracted. Further, the integrity of the structure may have been affected and chance airframe failure was imminent. With all of these conditions, the Captain still opted to request for a priority landing when emergency landing was needed."

The airplane operated on Aerocaribbean Flight 883 from Port-au-Prince Airport (PAP), Haiti to Santiago-Antonio Maceo Airport (SCU), Cuba and Havana-JosÃ© MartÃ­ International Airport (HAV). It took off from Santiago at 16:44 and climbed to a cruising altitude of FL180. At 17:36 the crew contacted Havana Control, requesting permission to climb to FL200.
During the climb the Total Air Temperature (TAT) dropped from +3Â°C to -1Â°C. The airspeed dropped from 196 kts to 176 kts.
At 17:44, at FL200, the ICING caution light illuminated on the instrument panel with an associated chime. This was followed by the illumination of the AOA light several seconds later. At 17:46 the crew toggled the anti-icing switches on the overhead panel and contacted Havana Control to request permission to descent to FL160 due to icing.
However, the controller reported conflicting traffic 30 miles ahead. The crew then requested vectors to enable them to descend. Clearance was given to change course from 295Â° to 330Â°. At 17:49, with an airspeed of 156 kts, the airplane commenced a right bank. Then suddenly the airplane banked left and right before banking 90Â° to the left again with a steep nose down attitude. The crew struggled to control the plane, which was banking turning and losing altitude. At 17:51:03 the airplane struck mountainous terrain.
After a six-week investigation, civil aviation officials concluded that ""the flight was proceeding normally until it found itself in extreme meteorological conditions that caused the airplane to ice up severely at an altitude of 20,000ft (6,100 m). This, in conjunction with errors by the crew in managing the situation, caused the accident."""

1.2 Psychological aspect
Nil.
1.2.2 Psychosocial information
Nil.
1.2.3 Organizational information
a) Capacitation - a contributor
The lack of capacitation and training of the subcontractorsÂ’ professionals for handling aircraft material hindered the execution of an efficient maintenance work as prescribed by the manufacturer's manual, culminating in inadequate machining during the maintenance process.
b) Organizational Processes - a contributor
The lack of an effective process of supervision, both on the part of TRIP Linhas AÃ©reas and on the part of the other contractors and subcontractors allowed the existing maintenance servicesÂ’ latent failures not to be checked and corrected, in a way capable of subsidizing, in an adequate and safe manner, the execution of the landing gear maintenance service
The process of supervision of the TRIP Linhas AÃ©reas and the AV IndÃºstria AeronÃ¡utica Ltda. companies by the Civil Aviation Authority, prescribed by specific legislation in force, was not enough to mitigate the latent conditions present in the accident in question.
2 Operational Factor
2.1 Concerning the operation of the aircraft
a) Aircraft maintenance - a contributor
According to the technical opinion issued by the DCTA, the AFT PIVOT PIN (D61000 and SN 25) presented fracture surfaces with Â± 45Âº inclination, as well as a flat area with multiple initiations, indicative of a fracture mechanism related to fatigue.
In examinations of the external surface of the pin, in a region close to the fatigue fracture, cracks were observed that had initiated from scratches created by an inadequate maintenance machining process.
In the region where the overload-related fracture occurred, it was also possible to identify that the machining process had modified the profile of the part in the section transition region, by producing a depression. Thus, it can be said that the AFT PIVOT PIN (D61000 and SN 25) of the PR-TTI left main gear broke on account of fatigue, whose onset was facilitated by an inadequate machining process that had been performed in the section transition region of the pin.

15 Mar 2011,ATR 72-202 (F),EI-SLG,Air Contractors,0,near Edinburgh Airport,non,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/121791,ATR 72 (all series),_AT72,21:30,183,P&W Canada PW124B,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 2,0,Serious incident,En route,Ferry/positioning,Edinburgh Airport,Paris,"The aircraft had undergone routine maintenance at an engineering facility at Edinburgh Airport immediately prior to the incident flight.
Everything appeared normal during the crew’s pre-flight checks, which included a full-and-free check of the flying controls.
The aircraft took off at 21:22 from runway 24 at Edinburgh, with the co-pilot acting as the handling pilot.
After carrying out a standard instrument departure the crew climbed the aircraft to FL 230 at a speed of 170 kt with the autopilot engaged. As the aircraft levelled and accelerated through about 185 kt, the crew felt the aircraft roll to the left by about 5 to 10° and they noticed that the slip ball and rudder trim were both indicating fully right. The co-pilot disengaged the autopilot and applied right rudder in an attempt to correct the sideslip and applied aileron to correct the roll. He reported that the rudder felt unusually ""spongy"" and that the aircraft did not respond to his rudder inputs. Approximately 15° to 20° of right bank was required to hold a constant heading with the speed stabilised above 185 kt and a limited amount of aileron trim was applied to assist. Shortly after regaining directional control a FTL CTL caption appeared on the Crew Alert Panel (CAP) and the FLT CTL fault light illuminated on the overhead panel, indicating a fault with the rudder Travel Limitation Unit (TLU). The commander requested radar vectors from ATC for a return to Edinburgh, later declaring a PAN.

The crew carried out the required procedure from the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). As part of the procedure they established that both Air Data Computers (ADC) were operating, before manually selecting the TLU switch to the LO SPD position. The aircraft had at this point temporarily slowed to below 180 kt. The co-pilot reported that on selection of LO SPD more roll control input was required to maintain heading and that roll authority to the right was further reduced. The commander therefore decided to return the TLU switch to AUTO and the required roll control input reduced. The green LO SPD indicator light did not illuminate.

An approach was made to runway 24, the aircraft was established on the ILS and was normally configured for a full flap landing. The crew added 10 kt to their approach speed, in accordance with the QRH. The co-pilot had to operate the control wheel with both hands in order to maintain directional control; the commander operated the power levers in the latter stages of the final approach. The co-pilot reported that the aircraft became slightly more difficult to control as the speed reduced, but remained controllable.

The aircraft landed just to the left of the runway centreline, whereupon the commander assumed control of the aircraft and applied reverse thrust. Despite the application of full right rudder pedal during the rollout, the aircraft diverged towards the left side of the runway. The commander re-established directional control using the steering wheel tiller. The aircraft was taxied clear of the runway and back to the engineering facility for inspection.

Th subsequent investigation and testing demonstrated that it is possible to incorrectly install the cams on the rear rudder quadrant shaft during maintenance. In this incident, the right hand cam was installed in the incorrect orientation and neither an independent inspection nor an operational test of the TLU system was performed. The incorrectly installed right hand cam was not detected prior to releasing the aircraft to service. When the TLU system automatically activated as the aircraft accelerated through 185 kt, the right hand roller encountered resistance as it came into contact with the upper lobe of the incorrectly installed cam, rather than slotting into the vee groove. This caused an uncommanded rudder input and associated control difficulties.

Three safety recommendations were made to the manufacturer, ATR.

There were 21 passengers and five crew members on board. No one was injured.
The aircraft carried out a round trip from Shannon (SNN), Ireland to Manchester Airport (MAN), U.K. on behalf of Aer Lingus Regional. The return leg, Flight EI 6305, departed Manchester at 08:47. En-route operations were normal and, in consultation with ATC, the aircraft descended and was cleared to self-position to the DERAG waypoint for an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach to runway 24.
At 10:08 hrs the aircraft commenced an approach to runway 24 in strong and gusty crosswind conditions. Following a turbulent approach difficulty was experienced in landing the aircraft, which contacted the runway in a nose-down attitude and bounced. A go-around was performed and the aircraft was vectored for a second approach. During this second approach landing turbulence was again experienced. Following bounces the aircraft pitched nose down and contacted the runway heavily in a nose down attitude. The nose gear collapsed and the aircraft nose descended onto the runway. The aircraft sustained damage with directional control being lost. The aircraft came to rest at the junction of the runway and a taxiway.
Following engine shutdown the forward cabin crew member advised the cockpit that there was no smoke and that the doors could be opened following which, an evacuation was commenced.

PROBABLE CAUSE:
1. Excessive approach speed and inadequate control of aircraft pitch during a crosswind landing in very blustery conditions.
CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS:
1. Confusing wording in the FCOM that led the crew to compute an excessive wind factor in the determination of Vapp.
2. Incorrect power handling technique while landing.
3. Inexperience of the pilot in command.
4. Inadequate information provided to flight crew regarding crosswind landing techniques.

The first officer was pilot flying and handed over control to the captain. No fire was observed but two extinguishing bottles were fired. The captain reset the Electronic Engine Control to verify that it operated correctly.
There was still a warning for engine number 2. The crew decided to return to Medan where a safe landing was made.
The airplane operated flight IW 1252. The NTSC were notified about this serious incident on August 15 by the engine manufacturer. The airline had failed to notify NTSC."

At the destination, they carried out an ILS approach to runway 13L. Twelve seconds after wheel touchdown, at a speed of around 70 kt, the captain detected an anomaly and then, three seconds later, announced ""fault on MFC ... fault on both MFCs"" and that he no longer had control of the aeroplane.
In his statement he said that the steering wheel did not respond to his actions and that he had the impression that the brakes were not acting normally. He decided to use the emergency braking system. During the landing roll, the aeroplane deviated from its path, first to the right and then to the left, coming to a halt two thirds along and slightly off the runway. The nose gear was found at 90Â° to the longitudinal axis of the aeroplane. The passengers disembarked from the aeroplane and were taken to the terminal by bus. Inspections carried out after the incident found hard braking marks on the runway and reported that the MFC 1B and MFC 2B FAULT lights were on.

Causes:
The runway excursion on landing was the result of the loss of control of the nose gear and of it turning so that it was perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the aeroplane.
The loss of control of the nose gear was due to a simultaneous double fault on MFCs 1B and 2B, detected by the crew during a critical flight phase.
The cause of this double fault was identified and was the result of a system error during the synchronization of the generation of aural warnings for the crew.
The loss of braking power felt by the captain could not be explained by the investigation.

The commander was Pilot Non Flying (PNF) and the first officer was Pilot Flying (PF).
Shortly after take-off from runway 22R while climbing through approximately 134 feet Radio Altitude (RA), a cockpit Master Warning was triggered referring to left engine low oil pressure. The cockpit Master Warning was silenced. Subsequently, a cockpit Master Caution was triggered referring to left engine high inner stage turbine temperature (ITT). Visual smoke was present in the cockpit and in the passenger cabin.
The flight crew decided to shut down the left engine (memory items). While climbing through approximately 750 feet RA, a cockpit Master Warning was triggered referring to left engine fire. The cockpit Master Warning was silenced.
A Mayday call to Kastrup Tower was made and the firefighting services of the airport were activated. The commander took over the control of the aircraft (PF) and initiated a left hand visual circling to runway 22L.
The flight crew noted the left engine fire warning lights (red light in the left condition lever and red light in the left fire handle). Engine fire agent number one was discharged.
Engine fire agent number two was discharged and the flight crew decided to land on runway 30 instead of landing on runway 22L.
On final to runway 30, the flight crew advised Kastrup Tower of a coming emergency evacuation of the aircraft on runway 30.
A single engine landing was performed. On runway 30, the flight crew observed that the fire had extinguished and they cancelled the emergency evacuation of the aircraft. The passengers were instructed to calmly disembark the aircraft through the passenger entrance door.
The root cause of the engine failure and engine fire was found to be fatigue crack propagation caused by casting defects (shrinkage porosities) of one of the Power Turbine (PT) stage 1 blades, which led to fracture. The fractured blade caused a lot of fractured PT stage 2 blades and the PT Rotor came in unbalance and broke the bolts holding the Rotor shaft Bearing Housing No 6 & 7 and this caused the housing to rotate. As a result of the rotating bearing housing, all the force was put on the Bearing Housing oil transfer tubes and caused them to break, subsequently leading to an oil leak. The internal oil leak caused a fire. The leaking oil continued out to the bottom of the nacelle and the internal oil fire then spread outsideto the nacelle area.
The technical investigation revealed that this event was not an isolated event. The AIB-DK concluded that at the time of the serious incident, there were unidentified PT1 blades from the same Batch (Heat) in circulation around the world as the fractured PT1 blade - with micro shrinkage porosity.
As a consequence of a Tri-National investigation, five safety recommendations have been made and forwarded to EASA and Transport Canada (TC).

Possible Causes
The approach of the loading/unloading vehicle without:
- Immobilizing the vehicle before entering the safety perimeter of the aircraft parking area,
- Restarting it at a low speed,
- Aligning it parallel to the aircraft fuselage at a safe distance, and
- Being guided by specialized personnel from the ground handling service provider.

Contributing Factors:
The lack of detailed written procedures by the ground handling provider for approaching the aircraft supplies near the fuselage and, specifically, the loading/unloading vehicle (high-loader) of this type, in accordance with the specific approach requirements of the serviced companies.

Master Warning was triggered referring to Engine 1 low oil pressure, but shortly after any malfunction indication disappeared.
Climb continued till acceleration altitude with one more short Eng1 oil LP indication.
At 1570 ft, when climb sequence was completed and Bleed valves switched on, oil LP indication popped up again while ITT value dropped to zero.
In absence of additional abnormal parameters, the crew believed in a faulty indication, but soon visual and aural warnings notified an Eng 1 fire condition, together with smoke in the cabin.
So, an in-flight engine fire emergency procedure was applied by shutting down the engine and attempting to discharge the extinguisher agent.
An emergency call was made to Firenze APP and the crew stated his intention to come back to the airport to land on runway 05. Approach and landing took place uneventfully and the precautionary fire brigade assistance was
provided when aircraft stopped on Taxiway P. Precautionary evacuation was carried out at that stage due to “HT brake warning light on”.
The investigation highlighted that the “fire or severe mechanical damage” emergency procedures were revised by ATR at least three times in fourteen months (only the month is edited on the revised pages) and introduced with a consistent delay in the AFM owned by the operator, therefore being effective for the crew."

As the aircraft passed over a ridge on the approach the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) activated and a go-around was initiated. Following this, a non-precision approach was flown which resulted in a successful landing. During that approach similar problems with the glideslope were experienced.

Probable Cause:
The absence of a Glideslope Antenna Deflector resulted in unstable glideslope signal reception which led to the autopilot descending the aircraft below the glide path in IMC.

Contributory Cause(s):
1. Ineffective monitoring and lack of situational awareness by the Flight Crew.
2. Inability of the EIKY ATC to monitor the aircraft due to lack of a radar display.

The propeller blades and the GPU sustained damage. No injuries reported.

Causes:
The incident analyzed in this report occurred as a result of the aircraft starting to move forward without this movement being noticed by the crew. The aircraft was able to move because the parking brake had been released, without the crew being consciously aware of having done so.
The cause of the incident was the failure of the crew to adhere to procedures.
The low visibility at the time of the event could have contributed to hampering the acquisition of visual references outside the cockpit.

2 Apr 2012,ATR 72-201,VP-BYZ,UTair Aviation,33,"1,6 km SW of Tyumen Airport (TJM)",w/o,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/320958,ATR 72 (all series),_AT72,07:35,332,P&W Canada PW124B,Fatalities: 33 / Occupants: 43,0,Accident,Initial climb,Passenger - Scheduled,Tyumen-Roschino International Airport (TJM/USTR),Surgut Airport (SGC/USRR),"UTair Aviation flight 120, an ATR 72-201, stalled and crashed shortly after takeoff from Tyumen-Roschino Airport, Russia, killing 33 occupants; 10 survived the accident.

Flight 120 took off from Tyumen Airport runway 21 on a regular domestic passenger flight to Surgut (SGC). The ATR-72 climbed to a height of 210 m and then banked 35Â° left, followed by a 50Â° right hand bank. It then struck a snowy field approx. 1,6 km past the end of the runway, broke up and a fire erupted.
The Interstate Aviation Committee stated that both engines were working properly at the time of the accident.
The Federal Air Transport Agency reported that the airplane had been parked outside for eight hours in weather conditions which included snow and temperatures at and just below freezing level. The airplane was not de-iced prior to departure and the crew did not insist on being de-iced.

Causes:
The immediate cause of the ATR 72-201 VP-BYZ aircraft accident was the PIC's decision to takeoff without de/anti-icing treatment despite the fact that snow and ice deposits were present on aircraft surface and were discovered by the crew members during taxi which resulted in degradation of aircraft aerodynamic performance and stall during climbing after takeoff as well as inability of the crew to recognize stall and, consequently, failure to undertake recovery procedure.

The aircraft stall occurred at the operational angles of attack right after flaps retraction with engaged autopilot before stall warning system activation and was caused by the loss of the wing lift effectiveness due to takeoff with non-removed ground icing.
The system cause of the accident were shortcomings in ground handling activities and staff training in UTAir-Technik that became possible because of absence of due monitoring by the Technical and Operation Supervising Directorates of UTAir airline for compliance with airline requirements regarding ground handling and aircraft ground icing protection which resulted in erroneous evaluation of aircraft conditions by the PIC and aircraft mechanic (the shift head kept himself aloof from monitoring mechanic's activities) after the aircraft has been on ground in icing conditions for a long time and in release the aircraft to fly without de/anti-icing treatment.
The contributing factors were:
- The shortcomings in the UTAir safety management system, which contains, all in all, general issues only and is not adopted for the implementation of Airline activities in particular areas, which did not allow to reveal and correct existing safety risks in a timely manner.
- The shortcomings in the UTAir-Technic quality management system, resulted in neglecting of certain requirements of the UTAir ground handling management manual regarding staff training and monitoring for aircraft de/anti-icing treatment which led to the situation when not sufficiently-qualified staff performed the evaluation of the aircraft surface conditions and made the decision on need for the aircraft to be de-iced/anti-iced.
- The absence at the time of the accident of basic regulations in force that establish state requirements for ground handling (de/anti-icing treatment in particular) including staff training and organization licensing.
- The shortcomings in crewmembers initial and recurrent training as far as the danger of ground icing, its influence on the aircraft aerodynamic performance together with aircraft anti-icing system operation features and design are concerned that did not allow the crew to make the only appropriate decision to return for de-icing/anti-icing treatment after the observation of the snow and ice contamination on the wing after anti-icing system activation in de-icing mode while taxiing for takeoff.
- The methodological imperfection of the crew computer based and simulator training programs concerning the prevention of aircraft stall, identification of approach to stall and taking timely actions for recovery.
- The increasing need for number of flight crews to perform highly growing flights schedule which, with ineffective SMS, resulted in flight instructor work deficiencies during PIC training and absence of PIC skills to take correct decisions and to strictly comply with the regulations in force.
- The possible fatigue of the crew members due to the violation of the work and rest balance while performing split flight shifts together with a large number of unused days-off.

The crew shut the engine down, activated the fire suppression system and returned to Sung Shan for a safe landing about 40 minutes after departure.

Findings related to Risks include maintenance related, flight operations and Air Traffic Control (ATC):

Maintenance related finding include the no. 2 engine throttle did not reach the rated torque output of target value and meet the requirement of the flight operation in the occurrence.

Flight Operations related findings include the flight crew did not initiate ENG Fire memory items immediately prior to request air-turn-back, did not prioritize the tasks and flight management which increased the work load and influence the aircraft operation; the flight crew neither mention the aircraft was under single engine operation nor announce the emergency situation during the air-turn-back, therefore the controller was unable to acknowledge the situation, unfavorable for controller’s judgment, planning and assistance; the aircraft did not capture the ILS due to the flight crew did not Arm App Mode immediately, set the correct course and turn left heading to 45 degrees, the deviation was 1.273 dots and the aircraft was passing through the course; the flight crew altered the default altitude to 3,800 ft and cancelled AFCS ALT HOLD MODE of 2,800 ft and continue descending without receiving any updated clearance or GS MODE activation, the aircraft might deviated from the assigned attitude and closed to the ground obstacle; the flight crew did not climb immediately and obtain maximum obstacle separation as ATR72 EGPWS Enhanced Mode warning and recovery procedures required, led the aircraft emitted stall warning and temporary abnormal condition; the TransAsia Airways (TNA) ATR FCTM of EGPWS Mode 2 warning procedure was pitch the aircraft up to 25 degrees, this procedure might led the aircraft to stall condition due to the aircraft might be under low speed, different configuration, engine failure and other abnormal condition; the aircraft might have different configuration and need to maintain maximum climb speed when encountering EGPWS warning, the manufacture ATR-72 FCOM EGPWSs Mode 2 warning recovery procedure might need further explanation from the manufacture prior to flight crew initiate the procedure.

ATC related risk findings include when the approach control controller instructed GE 515 to intercept the final approach course, the aircraft was higher than the glide path; the approach control’s Air Situation Display (ASD) no longer displayed the Air Traffic Management System (ATMS) warning of the aircraft after the approach control handed over to control tower, the approach control was unable to initiate the potential safety risk reminder to the tower.

There are 5 other findings in the report.

Regarding to the recommendations related to the subject issue of 1st stage PT blade failures on PW100 engines caused by the micro-porosity problem, P&WC is in the process of reviewing the life limitation for 1st stage PT blades installed on the higher-powered PW100 engines.

The wind at the time was reported as 230°, 13 gusting 23 kts. It seems that the aircraft touched down first on its main landing gear but bounced and the next contact with the runway was on the nose-wheel. Initial analysis of the FDR suggests that the aircraft initially landed on the main gear with a nose up pitch attitude of approximately 2.5°. Initial touchdown appears to re cord a force of 1.149g. The nose gear touched down shortly after the main gear with a recorded force of 1.707g.

Probable Cause
1. Inadequate control of aircraft pitch in the flare during a crosswind landing in gusty and turbulent conditions.

Contributory Causes
1. The average approach speed exceeded the calculated VAPP by approximately 5 kts which, when combined with the gusts experienced during the flare, may have contributed to the bounce.

2. An operational restriction on the Commander meant that he could not make an approach to RWY 25, which had a significantly lower crosswind component than that experienced on RWY 17.

There were 58 passengers and four crew members on board. Six passengers sustained minor injuries.
Lufthansa subsidiary Air Dolomiti operated flight LH1912 from Munich to Venice, Italy. The flight departed at 13:34. Shortly after takeoff smoke was reported in the cabin. The captain decided to return to Munich.
After receiving clearance to descend to FL110, engine power was reduced. At that time the flight crew noted a Master Caution alert and a fire warning for engine no.2. The pilots fired the extinguishing bottle in engine no.2 and proceeded to shut it down.
The descent was continued while the flight crew worked the appropriate checklists.
After landing on runway 26L, the ATR 72 began turning left until it ran off the side of the runway. The airplane went into the grass and came to rest with the nose gear collapsed.

It was found that the engine failure was caused by a broken turbine blade in the second stage of the power turbine [PT-2]. The turbine blade above the root in the area of the wing had fractured due to fatigue fracture followed by residual fracture due to tensile overload.
It was also found that the Travel Limiter Unit (TLU), which limits the travel of the rudder, was in high-speed mode and could only be moved to a limited extent.

Approximately 30 nautical miles north-east of JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping, an airprox occurred with PH-DCI that had taken off from JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping en route to Bromma on a north-easterly heading and that was climbing to Flight Level 150.
During the airprox, there was a separation minima infringement upon which both aircraft's collision warning systems were activated. The crews of both aircraft performed evasive manoeuvres in accordance with the collision warning systems' instructions.
Air traffic control did not clearly perceive the TCAS alarm and attempted to modify the aircraft flight paths.

The minimum vertical distance between the aircraft was 300 feet at a horizontal distance of 3.24 nautical miles (nm). The minimum horizontal distance was 1.75 nm with an altitude difference of 800 feet.


The serious incident was caused by the following factors:
ï‚· The air traffic controller's focus was on an early handover of flights to another sector.
ï‚· Air traffic control's aids for noticing the conflict were not capable of breaking the mental picture that the controller had of the situation in the sector

The Finnish Accident Investigation Board classified this as a serious incident and launched an investigation.

Probable cause and consequence
The serious incident was caused by the mechanically centred rudder’s insufficient authority for directional control, which resulted in the aircraft veering off the runway.
Contributing factors
The rudder’s Travel Limitation Unit (TLU) electric actuator broke and the TLU was left in the high speed (HI SPD) mode for the approach and landing, jamming the rudder.
Due to inadequate system awareness and the fact that the QRH did not clearly enough provide instructions for using the TLU’s standby system, the flight crew did not switch on the TLU’s standby system.
The right engine’s propeller blade angles transitioned sooner into the BETA zone following the reduction of engine power at landing, which resulted in a large directional oscillation.

Just after touch down the commander, who was pilot flying (PF), retarded the engine power levers to position ground idle (GI). The left engine engaged the GI, but the right engine did not follow the command.
The aircraft started to veer to the left and the pilot flying tried to select reverse on both engines in order to compensate for the left momentum. At the same time the first officer who was the pilot not flying, called out twice ""one low pitch"", which warned the captain that only one engine was in ground idle.
As the aircraft continued to veer to the left the captain tried to regain directional control by right hand rudder input and the use of right wheel brakes. The aircraft continued to veer to the left and ran off the side of the runway and entered the safety zone (short grass) with the left hand runway marking lights to the right of the aircraft.
After approximately 350 meters in the safety zone the captain regained control of the aircraft and entered runway 22L again.
The PF taxied the aircraft with low taxi speed to the nearby taxiway B5 and stopped.

Of the 50 occupants, five sustained serious injuries.
Alitalia flight 1670 had departed Pisa-Galileo Galilei Airport (PSA) on a domestic flight to Roma-Fiumicino Airport (FCO). This flight was operated by Carpatair on behalf of Alitalia.
The airplane flew the approach in strong cross wind conditions with wind shear reported at runway 16L some fifteen minutes before the landing. Shortly before touchdown the airplane suddenly lost altitude and impacted the runway with the nose landing gear. This was at a distance of 567 meters from the runway threshold.
It bounced three times, causing the nose and main gear to collapse. The airplane slid off the left side of the runway and came to rest in the grass near taxiway DE, at a distance of about 1780 meters from the runway threshold. The aircraft had also performed a rotation on the vertical axis of 170Â°, thus assuming a definitive orientation of about 330Â° magnetic. It came to rest 400 m from fire station no. 1. However, it took the fire services ten minutes to reach the airplane because they were not aware of the precise location of the accident.

The airplane landed in strong winds from 250 degrees on runway 16L. Runway 25 at Fiumicino was Notamed not available for landings due to work in progress.
The Fiumicino Notam reported at the time of the accident of the following limitations of the runway 16L ILS:
- LOCALIZER AT 17NM MRA 3000FT AND AT 25NM MRA 4000FT
- GLIDE PATH COVERAGE REDUCED AT 8.5NM

The ATR 72-212 has a demonstrated maximum crosswind component of 35 kts on a dry runway.

CAUSES: (translated from Italian)
The accident is due to the human factor. In particular, it was caused by an improper conduct of the aircraft by the PF (commander) during landing, not consistent with the provisions of the operator's manuals, in an environmental context characterized by the presence of significant criticality (presence of crosswind with values at the limit/excess those allowed for the ATR 72) and in the absence of an effective CRM.
The following factors may have contributed to the event.
- The failure to carry out the landing briefing, which, in addition to being required by company regulations, would have been an important moment of pooling and acceptance of information fundamental to the safety of operations.
- The maintenance of a V APP significantly higher than expected.
- The conviction of the commander (PF), deriving from his considerable general and specific experience on the aircraft in question, to be able to conduct a safe landing in spite of the presence of critical wind conditions for the type of aircraft.
- The considerable difference in experience between the commander and the first officer, which has reasonably prevented the latter from showing his critical capacity, thus rendering CRM techniques ineffective.
After the accident, the application of the PEA revealed some critical issues, which did not allow to carry out in a timely and effective manner the search and rescue of the aircraft and its occupants.

After landing on runway 14L, the co-pilot transferred the flight controls to the captain. The crew the perceived a noise followed by vibrations coming from the nose gear. At the end of landing roll, as they were about to turn left via the taxiway to the parking area, the captain noticed that the nosewheel steering control was no longer working. He continued braking the aircraft. A noise was again heard at the front and the aircraft came to rest on the runway centreline.

Cause
Uncoupling of the compass from the nose gear is caused by the loss of the retaining pin during rolling on landing.

This loss may be due to :
- incorrect positioning of one of the components of the assembly ;
- weakening of the bolt/nut assembly due to corrosion of the bolt thread and probably the nut.

Flight 4184 was scheduled to depart the gate in Indianapolis at 14:10; however, due to a change in the traffic flow because of deteriorating weather conditions at destination Chicago-O'Hare, the flight left the gate at 14:14 and was held on the ground for 42 minutes before receiving an IFR clearance to O'Hare. At 14:55, the controller cleared flight 4184 for takeoff. The aircraft climbed to an enroute altitude of 16,300 feet. At 15:13, flight 4184 began the descent to 10,000 feet. During the descent, the FDR recorded the activation of the Level III airframe de-icing system. At 15:18, shortly after flight 4184 leveled off at 10,000 feet, the crew received a clearance to enter a holding pattern near the LUCIT intersection and they were told to expect further clearance at 15:45, which was revised to 16:00 at 15:38. Three minutes later the Level III airframe de-icing system activated again. At 15:56, the controller contacted flight 4184 and instructed the flight crew to descend to 8,000 feet. The engine power was reduced to the flight idle position, the propeller speed was 86 percent, and the autopilot remained engaged in the vertical speed (VS) and heading select (HDG SEL) modes. At 15:57:21, as the airplane was descending in a 15-degree right-wing-down attitude at 186 KIAS, the sound of the flap overspeed warning was recorded on the CVR. The crew selected flaps from 15 to zero degrees and the AOA and pitch attitude began to increase. At 15:57:33, as the airplane was descending through 9,130 feet, the AOA increased through 5 degrees, and the ailerons began deflecting to a right-wing-down position. About 1/2 second later, the ailerons rapidly deflected to 13:43 degrees right-wing-down, the autopilot disconnected. The airplane rolled rapidly to the right, and the pitch attitude and AOA began to decrease. Within several seconds of the initial aileron and roll excursion, the AOA decreased through 3.5 degrees, the ailerons moved to a nearly neutral position, and the airplane stopped rolling at 77 degrees right-wing-down. The airplane then began to roll to the left toward a wings-level attitude, the elevator began moving in a nose-up direction, the AOA began increasing, and the pitch attitude stopped at approximately 15 degrees nose down. At 15:57:38, as the airplane rolled back to the left through 59 degrees right-wing-down (towards wings level), the AOA increased again through 5 degrees and the ailerons again deflected rapidly to a right-wing-down position. The captain's nose-up control column force exceeded 22 pounds, and the airplane rolled rapidly to the right, at a rate in excess of 50 degrees per second. The captain's nose-up control column force decreased below 22 pounds as the airplane rolled through 120 degrees, and the first officer's nose-up control column force exceeded 22 pounds just after the airplane rolled through the inverted position (180 degrees). Nose-up elevator inputs were indicated on the FDR throughout the roll, and the AOA increased when nose-up elevator increased. At 15:57:45 the airplane rolled through the wings-level attitude (completion of first full roll). The nose-up elevator and AOA then decreased rapidly, the ailerons immediately deflected to 6 degrees left-wing-down and then stabilized at about 1 degree right-wing-down, and the airplane stopped rolling at 144 degrees right wing down. At 15:57:48, as the airplane began rolling left, back towards wings level, the airspeed increased through 260 knots, the pitch attitude decreased through 60 degrees nose down, normal acceleration fluctuated between 2.0 and 2.5 G, and the altitude decreased through 6,000 feet. At 15:57:51, as the roll attitude passed through 90 degrees, continuing towards wings level, the captain applied more than 22 pounds of nose-up control column force, the elevator position increased to about 3 degrees nose up, pitch attitude stopped decreasing at 73 degrees nose down, the airspeed increased through 300 KIAS, normal acceleration remained above 2 G, and the altitude decreased through 4,900 feet. At 15:57:53, as the captain's nose-up control column force decreased below 22 pounds, the first officer's nose-up control column force again exceeded 22 pounds and the captain made the statement ""nice and easy."" At 15:57:55, the normal acceleration increased to over 3.0 G. Approximately 1.7 seconds later, as the altitude decreased through 1,700 feet, the elevator position and vertical acceleration began to increase rapidly. The last recorded data on the FDR occurred at an altitude of 1,682 feet (vertical speed of approximately 500 feet per second), and indicated that the airplane was at an airspeed of 375 KIAS, a pitch attitude of 38 degrees nose down with 5 degrees of nose-up elevator, and was experiencing a vertical acceleration of 3.6 G. The airplane impacted a wet soybean field partially inverted, in a nose down, left-wing-low attitude.
Based on petitions filed for reconsideration of the probable cause, the NTSB on September 2002 updated its findings.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The loss of control, attributed to a sudden and unexpected aileron hinge moment reversal, that occurred after a ridge of ice accreted beyond the deice boots while the airplane was in a holding pattern during which it intermittently encountered supercooled cloud and drizzle/rain drops, the size and water content of which exceeded those described in the icing certification envelope. The airplane was susceptible to this loss of control, and the crew was unable to recover.
Contributing to the accident were
1) the French Directorate General for Civil Aviation's (DGAC's) inadequate oversight of the ATR 42 and 72, and its failure to take the necessary corrective action to ensure continued airworthiness in icing conditions;
2) the DGAC's failure to provide the FAA with timely airworthiness information developed from previous ATR incidents and accidents in icing conditions,
3) the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) failure to ensure that aircraft icing certification requirements, operational requirements for flight into icing conditions, and FAA published aircraft icing information adequately accounted for the hazards that can result from flight in freezing rain,
4) the FAA's inadequate oversight of the ATR 42 and 72 to ensure continued airworthiness in icing conditions; and
5) ATR's inadequate response to the continued occurrence of ATR 42 icing/roll upsets which, in conjunction with information learned about aileron control difficulties during the certification and development of the ATR 42 and 72, should have prompted additional research, and the creation of updated airplane flight manuals, flightcrew operating manuals and training programs related to operation of the ATR 42 and 72 in such icing conditions.

After a flight from Penghu Island the ATR-72 the aircraft was cleared by Taipei Tower for a visual approach to runway 10.
The aircraft descended until it impacted a wooded hillside at an altitude of 300 m. At that point during the approach the aircraft should have been at 640-770 m.

Causes of the Incident
The investigation team identified the following factors as a combination of circumstances leading to the incident:
- Poor coordination between the captain and the first officer.
- During the Lunar New Year holiday period, the flight crew engaged in casual conversation without passengers onboard, gradually losing their situational awareness of the environment.
- The flight crew may not have maintained adequate situational awareness during the flight, failing to recognize proximity to the ground.
- The ILS (Instrument Landing System) received false signals, but the flight crew did not use other navigational aids for verification and distinction."
16 Feb 1997,ATR 72-202,G-BVTJ,"British Airways Express, opb CityFlyer Express",0,Near Liverpool,min,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/494055,ATR 72-200,AT72,13:50,342,P&W Canada PW124B,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 70,0,,En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Dublin Airport (DUB/EIDW),London-Gatwick Airport (LGW/EGKK),"During a previous flight on 19 December 1996 and whilst in the cruise , acrid smoke and fumes affected the flight deck causing the crew to transmit a 'Pan' call before making a precautionary descent and diversion into Bristol Airport. The smoke drill was actioned by the crew and, during the descent, the fumes dissipated and the aircraft landed safely. Subsequent engineering inspection of the air conditioning system failed to find any evidence of oil ingress, burning or smoke damage. Since level 2 anti-icing had been in use at the time of the incident, the engines were ground run at 80% torque for some 2 minutes. However, no signs of overheating or smoke were observed
and the aircraft was therefore released back to service, with no attendant recurrence of the fault.
However, on 16 February 1997 the aircraft was returning from Dublin to London Gatwick when traces of smoke, accompanied by pungent fumes, again appeared on the flight deck. At about this time, the cabin staff reported that there was smoke in the centre area of the cabin, around seat row 6, and that the cabin walls in this area were 'hot'. The commander declared an emergency and diverted into Liverpool. After subsequent inspection the aircraft was cleared for a flight to Gatwick Airport where more detailed engineering checks could be carried out. Following arrival at Gatwick a problem was identified with the No 1 air conditioning recirculation fan/control circuit where a
relay, positioned beneath row 6 in the passenger cabin, was found to show evidence of electrical arcing and overheating. Overheating damage was also evident on the cabin air recirculation fan motor. This unit was removed from the aircraft and sent to the manufacturer for inspection and rectification, and a report has been requested by the AAIB.

21 Dec 1997,ATR 72-202,G-BWTL,"British Airways Express, opb CityFlyer Express",0,near Goodwood,non,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/544175,ATR 72-200,AT72,c. 19:06 LT,441,P&W Canada PW124B,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 54,0,,Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,London-Gatwick Airport (LGW/EGKK),"Jersey Airport, Channel Islands (JER/EGJJ)","The crew reported for duty at 1005 hours. Their first scheduled sector was an 1120 hrs departure
for Cork, returning to Gatwick at 1515 hrs. This was to be followed by a 1545 hrs departure for
Jersey, returning to Gatwick at 1815 hrs. For operational reasons the first sector was changed to an
1140 hrs departure for Amsterdam, returning to Gatwick at 1450 hrs. The late arrival of some of the
passengers delayed departure until 1320 hrs; the aircraft arrived back at Gatwick at 1640 hrs.
The aircraft eventually took off at 1740 hrs for Jersey; the first officer was the handling pilot. The
flight progressed normally and the aircraft was transferred to Jersey Zone control at 1801 hrs. At
that time the RVR on Runway 09 was greater than 1,500 metres. The aircraft was transferred to
Jersey Approach control at 1808 hrs and was given radar vectors for the ILS approach to
Runway 09.

By 1811 hrs the RVR had reduced to 750 metres at touchdown, 600 metres at midpoint and 650
metres at the stop end; the required minima was 800 metres. The commander decided to hold at the
'JW'. Before the aircraft reached the beacon, there was a temporary improvement to 800 metres but
no sooner had the commander decided to make an approach than it deteriorated to 550 metres. The
aircraft continued towards the 'JW' and descended to 3,000 feet.

At 1818 hrs the RVR increased to 900 metres and once again the commander decided to attempt an
approach. The crew reported that they could see most of the island except for the area around the
airport. At 1820 hrs, the RVR reduced to 350 metres. The approach was discontinued from the
downwind position and the aircraft entered the hold at SHARK at 2,000 feet.

The RVR remained constant at 400 metres for some time and, at 1831 hrs, the commander told
ATC that he could hold for a further 15 minutes before having to return to Gatwick. He then
requested the RVR on Runway 27; this was 1,500 metres at touchdown, 450 metres at midpoint and
400 metres at the stop end. He decided to make an approach to Runway 27, however, the RVR
reduced to 600 metres, the minima for Runway 27. It deteriorated further to 350 metres but then
improved to 1,500 metres. The commander decided to continue the approach but by the time the
aircraft had reached the base leg, the RVR had reduced to 400 metres. The approach was
discontinued and the aircraft headed towards the 'JSY' VOR to take up the hold. The commander
made the decision to divert to Gatwick at 1847 hrs; he reported that the fuel remaining at that time
was 1,160 lb.

The commander called London Area Control at 1900 hrs and was told there were delays of 30 to
35 minutes at Gatwick; he was given a direct routing to Goodwood and told to expect a WILLO 3C
arrival. The commander acknowledged this and requested ""---- A PRIORITY LANDING AS WE'VE
BEEN HOLDING DOWN AT JERSEY----"". The controller asked how much holding fuel he had and was
told about 15 minutes.

At 1903 hrs, the controller advised the commander that he would be asked on the next frequency if
he was declaring an emergency. He explained that it was the only way ATC would be able to give
him a priority approach. The commander then told ATC that he would be able to hold for about 5
minutes. He confirmed that he would be declaring an emergency and the controller suggested that
he ""MIGHT AS WELL DECLARE YOUR EMERGENCY NOW"". The commander confirmed this at 1905
hrs and was subsequently told that he would be given radar vectors for a WILLO 3C arrival
followed by a straight in approach.

The first officer expressed his reservations about the commander's decision to declare an
emergency in order to continue the diversion to Gatwick; he considered that Southampton was the
preferred option as the weather was better and it was not fuel critical. He continued to express his
reservations even after the commander had made his decision.

At 1920 hrs, the commander called Gatwick Director and reported that they were descending to
FL70 on course to Goodwood.

Over the next two minutes the following transmissions were exchanged between the commander and ATC:

Aircraft ""----HOW ARE YOUR QUEUES NOW WE BY DECLARING AN EMERGENCY WE WERE TOLD WE WOULDN'T BE DELAYED WE COULD HOLD FOR TEN MINUTES OR SO AND CANCEL THE EMERGENCY IF THE DELAYS WERE ONLY TEN MINUTES OR SO"".

Controller ""--- THEY'RE STILL IN EXCESS OF TWENTY MINUTES"".

Aircraft ""---OH STILL IN EXCESS OF TWENTY MINUTES"".

Controller â€œ---YOU WISH TO CONFIRM THAT YOUR EMERGENCY STILL EXISTS"".

Aircraft ""----IT LOOKS AS IF WE REALLY OUGHT TO GO TO SOUTHAMPTON AND NOT DECLARE THE EMERGENCY ORIGINALLY WE WERE TOLD HALF AN HOUR WHICH WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US AND WE DON'T REALLY WANT TO DECLARE AN EMERGENCY ALTHOUGH IT'S A BIT LATE FOR THAT NOW"".

Shortly after this the commander spoke to the Company Operations. The first officer monitored this
conversation which initially went normally but then he became aware that the commander was not
responding. He reported that when he looked across at the commander, he was slumped in his seat,
his head was down and his eyes appeared to be ""unfocused"". There were beads of sweat starting to
appear on his forehead. The first officer talked to him and shook his arm, however, he got no
response.

Just before 1926 hrs the first officer made the following transmission:

""---WE DO DEFINITELY WANT TO CONTINUE TO GATWICK NOW MY SKIPPER IS NOT THAT WELL CURRENTLY I'LL KEEP YOU INFORMED I THINK HE'S STILL WITH ME""

At about 1927 hrs, the commander appeared to suddenly recover from his incapacitation. Initially,
he was very animated and after a short period of confusion he continued in the role of non-handling
pilot. The crew executed a standard Category 2 approach; the commander took control at decision
height and carried out a normal landing. The aircraft was on the ground at 1938 hrs.

A Local Standby had been initiated by ATC. The AFS attended the aircraft and followed it to the
stand. The commander had apparently fully recovered and declined to be examined by the
paramedics who attended; both crew members were interviewed by Airport Police before they left
the stand area.

Both aircraft were parked adjacent to the terminal building at Norwich. The B737, parked on Stand 2, was cleared by ATC to taxi for departure. The commander of the B737 stated that he was given the 'all clear' from the ground engineer and increased thrust from idle to 30% to 35% N1. This thrust setting was insufficient to move the aircraft so power was increased to 35% to 40% N1. After approximately 50 metres of travel the ground engineer signalled the commander to stop. A strip of tarmac, peeled from the apron surface, had become attached to the aircraft's nosewheel tyre. This
was removed, the remaining landing gear was examined and the aircraft continued to taxi.
The commander of the ATR 72, parked on Stand 3, stated that, as the B737 taxiied from the apron a wooden board was dislodged from a nearby baggage truck by the jet blast and struck and damaged the fin of his aircraft. The commander of the B737 was not aware of this incident as he continued to taxi.

At 20:33, the crew received clearance for takeoff on runway 22 from the air traffic control (Tower), with a wind report of 190 degrees at 1 knot. The weather was good, with no visibility issues during the dark night. The runway was dry.
During the takeoff roll, at the decision speed (V1), the crew felt two to three hard strikes against the nose gear. After a normal gear retraction, the crew checked all aircraft systems and found no deviations. The flight continued to the destination airport.
The pilot in command (PIC) informed the tower that the aircraft had apparently collided with an object on the runway during the takeoff roll.
A subsequent runway inspection revealed that three lights of the left runway edge lighting were destroyed.

The aircraft was carrying a cargo of fabric, leather, and electronic materials. At 01:51 the co-pilot contacted Taipei Control and requested permission to descend from FL180 to FL160. At 01:52:10, at an altitude of 17,853 feet, a stall warning sounded and the stick shaker activated. The crew disconnected the autopilot and tried maintain control of the airplane. Sixteen seconds later the aircraft descended through 14,465 feet. Within seven seconds the aircraft had descended through 10,246 feet at a speed of 320 knots. At 01:52:47 the plane passed an altitude of 3,027 feet. Three seconds later the cockpit voice recorder stopped working. The aircraft crashed into the sea.

FINDINGS RELATED TO PROBABLE CAUSES:
1. The accident flight encountered severe icing conditions. The liquid water content and maximum droplet size were beyond the icing certification envelope of FAR/JAR 25 appendix C.
2. TNA's training and rating of aircraft severe icing for this pilots has not been effective and the pilots have not developed a familiarity with the Note, CAUTION and WARNING set forth in Flight Crew Operating Manual and Airplane Flight Manual to adequately perform their duties.
3. After the flight crew detected icing condition and the airframe de-icing system was activated twice, the flight crew did not read the relative Handbook, thereby the procedure was not able to inform the flight crew and to remind them of ""be alert to severe icing detection"".
4. The ""unexpected decrease in speed"" indicated by the airspeed indicator is an indication of severe icing.
5. The flight crew did not respond to the severe Icing conditions with pertinent alertness and situation awareness that the aircraft might have encountered conditions which was ""outside that for which the aircraft was certificated and might seriously degrade the performance and controllability of the aircraft"".
6. The flight crew was too late in detecting the severe icing conditions. After detection, they did not change altitude immediately, nor take other steps required in the Severe Icing Emergency Procedures.
7. The aircraft was in an ""unusual or uncontrolled rolling and pitching"" state, and a stall occurred thereafter.
8. After the aircraft had developed a stall and an abnormal attitude, the recovery maneuvering did not comply with the operating procedures and techniques for Recovery of Unusual Attitudes. The performance and controllability of the aircraft may have been seriously degraded by then. It cannot be confirmed whether the unusual attitudes of the aircraft could have been recovered if the crew's operation had complied with the relevant procedures and techniques.
9. During the first 25 minutes, the extra drag increased about 100 counts, inducing a speed diminishing about 10 knots.
10. During the airframe de-icing system was intermittently switched off, it is highly probable that residual ice covered on the wings of the aircraft.
11. Four minutes prior to autopilot disengaged, the extra drag increased about 500 counts, and airspeed decayed to 158 knots, and lift-drag ratio loss about 64% rapidly.
12. During the 10s before the roll upset, the longitudinal and lateral stability has been modified by the severe ice accumulated on the wings producing the flow separation. Before autopilot disengaged, the aerodynamic of the aircraft (lift/drag) was degraded of about 40%.

On August 5, 2005 Tuninter's ATR-72 TS-LBB arrived at Tunis Airport with 790 kg of fuel left in the fuel tanks. During maintenance the Fuel Quantity Indicator (FQI) was changed. Erroneously the FQI for ATR-42 aircraft was installed. The normal operation of the FQI is to processes the signal coming from the capacitance probes installed in the tanks with an algorithm typical for each aircraft, depending on tank shape, size and number of probes installed. The indication of the amount of fuel on board the airplane now read 3050 kg instead of 790 kg.
On August 6 the airplane was prepared for flight 152F to Bari. An amount of 465 kg fuel was added for the flight (total fuel: 1255 kg, with 3800 kg indicated). Upon landing at Bari only 305 kg were left in the tanks. Normally this should have triggered a 'LO LVL' warning, but the FQI read 2300 kg, which made the crew believe they had plenty of fuel left. In preparation for the flight to Djerba, just 265 kg of fuel was added. The flight departed with 2700 kg of fuel indicated by the FQI (actual amount: 570 kg).
En route, at 15:24 the crew contacted Palermo for an emergency landing. They had run out of fuel and both engines had quit. Their FQI nevertheless showed 1800 kg of fuel. They did not make it to Palermo and ditched in the sea around 15:40.

CAUSE AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS:

The accident under examination, as most aviation accidents, has been determined by a series of events linked one another, which caused the final ditching. The ditching was primarly due to the both engines flame out because of fuel exhaustion.
The incorrect replacement of the fuel quantity indicator (FQI) was one of the contributing factors which led irremediably to the accident.
The accident's cause is therefore traceable firstly to the incorrect procedure used for replacing the FQI, by means of the operator's maintenance personnel. This shall be considered the disruptive element, which caused the final ditching of the aircraft due to the lack of fuel that caused the shutdown of both engines.
As said before the accident was determined by a series of events (contributing factors) linked one another. Hereafter are listed some considered of major importance.
- Errors committed by ground mechanics when searching for and correctly identifying the fuel indicator.
- Errors committed by the flight crew: non-respect of various operational procedures.
- Inadequate checks by the competent office of the operator that flight crew were respecting operational procedures.
- Inaccuracy of the information entered in the aircraft management and spares information system and the absence of an effective control of the system itself.
- Inadequate training for aircraft management and spares information system use and absence of a responsible person appointed for managing the system itself.
- Maintenance and organization standards of the operator unsatisfactory for an adequate aircraft management.
- Lack of an adequate quality assurance system;
- Inadequate surveillance of the operator by the competent Tunisian authority.
- Installation characteristics of fuel quantity indicators (FQI) for ATR 42 and ATR 72 which made it possible to install an ATR 42 type FQI in an ATR 72, and viceversa.

The analysis of various factors that contributed to the event has been carried out according to the so called ReasonÂ’s ""Organizational accident"" model. Active failures, which had triggered the accident, are those committed both by ground mechanics/technicians the day before the event while searching for and replacing the fuel quantity indicator, and by the crew who did not verify and fully and accurately complete the aircraftÂ’s documentation, through which it would have been possible to perceive an anomalous situation regarding the quantity of fuel onboard.
Latent failures, however, remained concealed, latent in the operator's organizational system until, some active errors (by mechanics and pilots) were made, overcoming the system's defence barriers, causing the accident.
Analysing latent and active failures (errors) traceable to various parties, involved in the event in several respects, it clearly emerges that they were operating in a potentially deceptive organizational system. When latent failures remain within a system without being identified and eliminated, the possibility of mutual interaction increases, making the system susceptible for active failures, or not allowing the system to prevent them, in case of errors. Active failures were inserted in a context characterised by organizational and maintenance deficiencies.
The error that led to the accident was committed by mechanics who searched for and replaced the FQI, but this error occurred in an organizational setting in which, if everybody were operating correctly, probably the accident would not have occurred.
Inaccuracy of information entered in the aircraft management and spares information system, particularly regarding the interchangeability of items and the absence of an effective control of the system itself, has been considered in fact one of the latent failures that contributed to the event. The maintenance and organization standards of the operator, at the time of event, were not considered satisfactory for an adequate management of the aircraft.
The flight crew and maintenance mechanics/technicians involved in the event,

There were no casualties.
The airplane landed nose-first and porpoised, causing a hard landing on the nose gear followed by nose landing gear collapse.

Probable Causes:
The accident occurred due to an excessive landing speed due to inadequate power control. The aircraft touched down with a negative pitch attitude and porpoised. The crew then used excessive downward elevator, causing aircraft to touch down with a vertical speed that exceeded the design limits of the front landing gear.

The airplane operated on Aerocaribbean Flight 883 from Port-au-Prince Airport (PAP), Haiti to Santiago-Antonio Maceo Airport (SCU), Cuba and Havana-JosÃ© MartÃ­ International Airport (HAV). It took off from Santiago at 16:44 and climbed to a cruising altitude of FL180. At 17:36 the crew contacted Havana Control, requesting permission to climb to FL200.
During the climb the Total Air Temperature (TAT) dropped from +3Â°C to -1Â°C. The airspeed dropped from 196 kts to 176 kts.
At 17:44, at FL200, the ICING caution light illuminated on the instrument panel with an associated chime. This was followed by the illumination of the AOA light several seconds later. At 17:46 the crew toggled the anti-icing switches on the overhead panel and contacted Havana Control to request permission to descent to FL160 due to icing.
However, the controller reported conflicting traffic 30 miles ahead. The crew then requested vectors to enable them to descend. Clearance was given to change course from 295Â° to 330Â°. At 17:49, with an airspeed of 156 kts, the airplane commenced a right bank. Then suddenly the airplane banked left and right before banking 90Â° to the left again with a steep nose down attitude. The crew struggled to control the plane, which was banking turning and losing altitude. At 17:51:03 the airplane struck mountainous terrain.
After a six-week investigation, civil aviation officials concluded that ""the flight was proceeding normally until it found itself in extreme meteorological conditions that caused the airplane to ice up severely at an altitude of 20,000ft (6,100 m). This, in conjunction with errors by the crew in managing the situation, caused the accident."""
15 Mar 2011,ATR 72-202 (F),EI-SLG,Air Contractors,0,near Edinburgh Airport,non,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/121791,ATR 72-200,AT72,21:30,183,P&W Canada PW124B,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 2,0,Serious incident,En route,Ferry/positioning,Edinburgh Airport,Paris,"The aircraft had undergone routine maintenance at an engineering facility at Edinburgh Airport immediately prior to the incident flight.
Everything appeared normal during the crew’s pre-flight checks, which included a full-and-free check of the flying controls.
The aircraft took off at 21:22 from runway 24 at Edinburgh, with the co-pilot acting as the handling pilot.
After carrying out a standard instrument departure the crew climbed the aircraft to FL 230 at a speed of 170 kt with the autopilot engaged. As the aircraft levelled and accelerated through about 185 kt, the crew felt the aircraft roll to the left by about 5 to 10° and they noticed that the slip ball and rudder trim were both indicating fully right. The co-pilot disengaged the autopilot and applied right rudder in an attempt to correct the sideslip and applied aileron to correct the roll. He reported that the rudder felt unusually ""spongy"" and that the aircraft did not respond to his rudder inputs. Approximately 15° to 20° of right bank was required to hold a constant heading with the speed stabilised above 185 kt and a limited amount of aileron trim was applied to assist. Shortly after regaining directional control a FTL CTL caption appeared on the Crew Alert Panel (CAP) and the FLT CTL fault light illuminated on the overhead panel, indicating a fault with the rudder Travel Limitation Unit (TLU). The commander requested radar vectors from ATC for a return to Edinburgh, later declaring a PAN.

The crew carried out the required procedure from the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). As part of the procedure they established that both Air Data Computers (ADC) were operating, before manually selecting the TLU switch to the LO SPD position. The aircraft had at this point temporarily slowed to below 180 kt. The co-pilot reported that on selection of LO SPD more roll control input was required to maintain heading and that roll authority to the right was further reduced. The commander therefore decided to return the TLU switch to AUTO and the required roll control input reduced. The green LO SPD indicator light did not illuminate.

An approach was made to runway 24, the aircraft was established on the ILS and was normally configured for a full flap landing. The crew added 10 kt to their approach speed, in accordance with the QRH. The co-pilot had to operate the control wheel with both hands in order to maintain directional control; the commander operated the power levers in the latter stages of the final approach. The co-pilot reported that the aircraft became slightly more difficult to control as the speed reduced, but remained controllable.

The aircraft landed just to the left of the runway centreline, whereupon the commander assumed control of the aircraft and applied reverse thrust. Despite the application of full right rudder pedal during the rollout, the aircraft diverged towards the left side of the runway. The commander re-established directional control using the steering wheel tiller. The aircraft was taxied clear of the runway and back to the engineering facility for inspection.

Th subsequent investigation and testing demonstrated that it is possible to incorrectly install the cams on the rear rudder quadrant shaft during maintenance. In this incident, the right hand cam was installed in the incorrect orientation and neither an independent inspection nor an operational test of the TLU system was performed. The incorrectly installed right hand cam was not detected prior to releasing the aircraft to service. When the TLU system automatically activated as the aircraft accelerated through 185 kt, the right hand roller encountered resistance as it came into contact with the upper lobe of the incorrectly installed cam, rather than slotting into the vee groove. This caused an uncommanded rudder input and associated control difficulties.

Three safety recommendations were made to the manufacturer, ATR.

At the destination, they carried out an ILS approach to runway 13L. Twelve seconds after wheel touchdown, at a speed of around 70 kt, the captain detected an anomaly and then, three seconds later, announced ""fault on MFC ... fault on both MFCs"" and that he no longer had control of the aeroplane.
In his statement he said that the steering wheel did not respond to his actions and that he had the impression that the brakes were not acting normally. He decided to use the emergency braking system. During the landing roll, the aeroplane deviated from its path, first to the right and then to the left, coming to a halt two thirds along and slightly off the runway. The nose gear was found at 90Â° to the longitudinal axis of the aeroplane. The passengers disembarked from the aeroplane and were taken to the terminal by bus. Inspections carried out after the incident found hard braking marks on the runway and reported that the MFC 1B and MFC 2B FAULT lights were on.

Causes:
The runway excursion on landing was the result of the loss of control of the nose gear and of it turning so that it was perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the aeroplane.
The loss of control of the nose gear was due to a simultaneous double fault on MFCs 1B and 2B, detected by the crew during a critical flight phase.
The cause of this double fault was identified and was the result of a system error during the synchronization of the generation of aural warnings for the crew.
The loss of braking power felt by the captain could not be explained by the investigation.

As the aircraft passed over a ridge on the approach the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) activated and a go-around was initiated. Following this, a non-precision approach was flown which resulted in a successful landing. During that approach similar problems with the glideslope were experienced.

Probable Cause:
The absence of a Glideslope Antenna Deflector resulted in unstable glideslope signal reception which led to the autopilot descending the aircraft below the glide path in IMC.

Contributory Cause(s):
1. Ineffective monitoring and lack of situational awareness by the Flight Crew.
2. Inability of the EIKY ATC to monitor the aircraft due to lack of a radar display.

Flight 120 took off from Tyumen Airport runway 21 on a regular domestic passenger flight to Surgut (SGC). The ATR-72 climbed to a height of 210 m and then banked 35Â° left, followed by a 50Â° right hand bank. It then struck a snowy field approx. 1,6 km past the end of the runway, broke up and a fire erupted.
The Interstate Aviation Committee stated that both engines were working properly at the time of the accident.
The Federal Air Transport Agency reported that the airplane had been parked outside for eight hours in weather conditions which included snow and temperatures at and just below freezing level. The airplane was not de-iced prior to departure and the crew did not insist on being de-iced.

Causes:
The immediate cause of the ATR 72-201 VP-BYZ aircraft accident was the PIC's decision to takeoff without de/anti-icing treatment despite the fact that snow and ice deposits were present on aircraft surface and were discovered by the crew members during taxi which resulted in degradation of aircraft aerodynamic performance and stall during climbing after takeoff as well as inability of the crew to recognize stall and, consequently, failure to undertake recovery procedure.

The aircraft stall occurred at the operational angles of attack right after flaps retraction with engaged autopilot before stall warning system activation and was caused by the loss of the wing lift effectiveness due to takeoff with non-removed ground icing.
The system cause of the accident were shortcomings in ground handling activities and staff training in UTAir-Technik that became possible because of absence of due monitoring by the Technical and Operation Supervising Directorates of UTAir airline for compliance with airline requirements regarding ground handling and aircraft ground icing protection which resulted in erroneous evaluation of aircraft conditions by the PIC and aircraft mechanic (the shift head kept himself aloof from monitoring mechanic's activities) after the aircraft has been on ground in icing conditions for a long time and in release the aircraft to fly without de/anti-icing treatment.
The contributing factors were:
- The shortcomings in the UTAir safety management system, which contains, all in all, general issues only and is not adopted for the implementation of Airline activities in particular areas, which did not allow to reveal and correct existing safety risks in a timely manner.
- The shortcomings in the UTAir-Technic quality management system, resulted in neglecting of certain requirements of the UTAir ground handling management manual regarding staff training and monitoring for aircraft de/anti-icing treatment which led to the situation when not sufficiently-qualified staff performed the evaluation of the aircraft surface conditions and made the decision on need for the aircraft to be de-iced/anti-iced.
- The absence at the time of the accident of basic regulations in force that establish state requirements for ground handling (de/anti-icing treatment in particular) including staff training and organization licensing.
- The shortcomings in crewmembers initial and recurrent training as far as the danger of ground icing, its influence on the aircraft aerodynamic performance together with aircraft anti-icing system operation features and design are concerned that did not allow the crew to make the only appropriate decision to return for de-icing/anti-icing treatment after the observation of the snow and ice contamination on the wing after anti-icing system activation in de-icing mode while taxiing for takeoff.
- The methodological imperfection of the crew computer based and simulator training programs concerning the prevention of aircraft stall, identification of approach to stall and taking timely actions for recovery.
- The increasing need for number of flight crews to perform highly growing flights schedule which, with ineffective SMS, resulted in flight instructor work deficiencies during PIC training and absence of PIC skills to take correct decisions and to strictly comply with the regulations in force.
- The possible fatigue of the crew members due to the violation of the work and rest balance while performing split flight shifts together with a large number of unused days-off.

The wind at the time was reported as 230°, 13 gusting 23 kts. It seems that the aircraft touched down first on its main landing gear but bounced and the next contact with the runway was on the nose-wheel. Initial analysis of the FDR suggests that the aircraft initially landed on the main gear with a nose up pitch attitude of approximately 2.5°. Initial touchdown appears to re cord a force of 1.149g. The nose gear touched down shortly after the main gear with a recorded force of 1.707g.

Probable Cause
1. Inadequate control of aircraft pitch in the flare during a crosswind landing in gusty and turbulent conditions.

Contributory Causes
1. The average approach speed exceeded the calculated VAPP by approximately 5 kts which, when combined with the gusts experienced during the flare, may have contributed to the bounce.

2. An operational restriction on the Commander meant that he could not make an approach to RWY 25, which had a significantly lower crosswind component than that experienced on RWY 17.

Just after touch down the commander, who was pilot flying (PF), retarded the engine power levers to position ground idle (GI). The left engine engaged the GI, but the right engine did not follow the command.
The aircraft started to veer to the left and the pilot flying tried to select reverse on both engines in order to compensate for the left momentum. At the same time the first officer who was the pilot not flying, called out twice ""one low pitch"", which warned the captain that only one engine was in ground idle.
As the aircraft continued to veer to the left the captain tried to regain directional control by right hand rudder input and the use of right wheel brakes. The aircraft continued to veer to the left and ran off the side of the runway and entered the safety zone (short grass) with the left hand runway marking lights to the right of the aircraft.
After approximately 350 meters in the safety zone the captain regained control of the aircraft and entered runway 22L again.
The PF taxied the aircraft with low taxi speed to the nearby taxiway B5 and stopped.

Following a normal touchdown, a severe nose wheel shimmy was experienced as the aircraft decelerated below 40 kts. Subsequent inspection of the nose leg assembly revealed that the nose landing gear (NLG) torque link apex pin assembly was missing.

AAIU Probable Cause:
It is likely that corrosion of the threaded portion of the apex pin had occurred such that the serrated washer and retaining nut separated from the link pin allowing the link pin to migrate free.
AAIU Contributory Cause:
The susceptibility of the link pin material to corrosion at the threaded portion following degradation of the cadmium protection.

ATR had earlier issued OIM 2014/003.

The Operator also identified a scenario whereby the misplacement of the nose wheel chock could lead to the displacement of the serrated (locking) washer.

4 Dec 2014,ATR 72-202,D-ANFE,"Avanti Air, opf Darwin Airline",0,Zürich-Kloten Airport (ZRH),sub,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/320397,ATR 72-200,AT72,08:02,272,Pratt & Whitney Canada PW124B,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 30,0,Accident,Landing,Passenger - Scheduled,Dresden Airport (DRS/EDDC),ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH/LSZH),"At 06:33 local time on 4 December 2014, an ATR 72-202, registration D-ANFE, took off from Dresden Airport, Germany on a scheduled flight to Zurich, Switzerland (LSZH).
As the result of a fault, during the cruising flight the air conditioning system unit 1 had to be reset once; thereafter it functioned normally for the remainder of the flight.
After an uneventful descent and approach, D-ANFE touched down normally at 08:02 on runway 14 at Zurich Airport in a light northerly wind. According to the flight crew's statements, the touchdown of the main landing gear and the nose landing gear occurred normally.
After the nose landing gear wheels had come into contact with the runway approximately 1050 m after the runway threshold, the tyre of the right nose landing gear wheel separated from the nose landing gear during landing roll. The nose landing gear continued to slide on the wheel rims approximately 470 m after nosewheel touchdown. The commander later stated that shortly before reaching intersection H1 he had noticed that the steering was not functioning correctly.
At 08:04:12 the copilot then reported the following to the air traffic controller (ATCO) in the aerodrome control tower (TWR): ""Darwin two eight six uh we have a problem, we're on the runway trying to vacate."" He also requested the ATCO to summon the fire brigade because he suspected hot brakes.
Steering was then performed by the flight crew by means of asymmetrical power setting of the two engines and by asymmetrical braking of the main landing gear wheels. The ATCO then instructed the crew to vacate the runway, if possible via intersection H1. This was also the flight crew's intention, since the vibrations increased during landing roll.
The two flight attendants later stated that after touchdown the aircraft had deviated somewhat to the right and the landing roll-out felt as if the runway was very bumpy.
The aircraft was brought to a standstill shortly afterwards at the Category (CAT) 1 stop bar on taxiway (TWY) H1. The fire-brigade arrived shortly afterwards at the aircraft and examined the brakes for overheating.
Once the aircraft had come to a standstill, the copilot asked the ATCO for a runway inspection of runway 14 to be performed, since he suspected there had been problems with the tyres and consequently damage to the runway. The runway inspection was undertaken immediately; a tyre from the nose landing gear of D-ANFE was found on the centre line of runway 14 approximately 2080 m from the runway threshold. In addition, abrasion marks were found; however, these were not assessed as restrictive for the continued operation of runway 14.

The accident is attributable to the fact that during landing the nose landing gear was not centred and so the two nose gear wheels could not turn freely. Subsequently it was no longer possible to exercise control via the nose landing gear steering system, as the nose landing gear was substantially damaged.
The interaction of the following factors was determined as the most probable cause of the accident:
- a valve input lever of the differential control selector valve which had been fitted to the nose landing gear in an inverted state (rotated through 180Â°);
- inadequate maintenance of the nose landing gear.
The fact that the valve input lever can be attached incorrectly, in an inverted state (rotated through 180Â°) as a result of its structural design was determined to be a contributing factor.
Though the small parts of the aircraft found on the runway during a runway inspection performed hours later did not contribute to the origin and history of the accident, they nevertheless constitute a factor to risk

25 Jan 2016,ATR 72-202,OY-LHA,Danish Air Transport,0,Karup Airport (KRP/EKKA),min,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/184199,ATR 72-200,AT72,06:20,508,P&W Canada PW124B,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 69,0,Serious incident,Take off,Passenger - Scheduled,Karup Airport (KRP/EKKA),KÃ¸benhavn-Kastrup Airport (CPH/EKCH),"An ATR 72-202, OY-LHA, sustained minor damage when it rolled over elevated runway edge lights when it attempted to take off while aligned with the runway edge lights along the right-hand side of runway 27L at Karup Airport in Denmark.
The Danish Air Transport flight was a scheduled domestic morning service to Copenhagen.
At 06:15 hours local time, Karup tower instructed the flight crew to taxi to the holding point at runway 27L via taxiway E, and the aircraft was cleared to cross runway 27R.
At 06:19 hours, the first officer reported to Karup tower that the aircraft was at the holding point to runway 27L (the category II holding point). The aircraft was cleared for take-off.
The tower air traffic controller reported the wind conditions to be 230Â° and 5 knots, the runway visual range (RVR) at the threshold of runway 27L to be 1700 meters, and the RVR at the midpoint of runway 27L to be 1600 meters.
While taxiing and lining up the aircraft on the underrun of runway 27L, the flight crew did the before take-off procedures. A runway heading and GPS alignment check was performed without remarks.
During the before take-off preparations, the aircraft still moved forwards at a ground idle power setting on the underrun of runway 27L for approximately 30 seconds.
While slowly taxiing towards the threshold of runway 27L, the aircraft hit a runway edge light (red light) on the right-hand side of runway 27L.
At the threshold of runway 27L, the commander added take-off power.
During the initial take-off roll, the flight crew observed a thumping noise from the nose gear, and the commander realigned the nose gear slightly to the left, which was done to avoid the thumping noises caused by the nose gear hitting, what the flight crew thought, were the recessed runway centre line lights.
The right main gear hit elevated runway edge lights along the right-hand side of runway 27L.
When approaching the military arrester cable mechanism on the right-hand side of runway 27L, the commander realized that the aircraft was incorrectly lined up on the runway edge lights along the right-hand side of runway 27L instead of the runway centreline lights of runway 27L. The commander aborted the take-off and manoeuvred the aircraft back to the centreline of the runway of runway 27L.

Karup Airport is a military base that is also used for civil operations. Runway 27L measures 2929 x 45 M.
Runway centreline lights are spaced 15 m apart while the white runway edge lights are spaced 60 m apart. The arrester cables are located 391 m from the runway threshold.

Probable Cause:
In darkness and hazy weather conditions, the flight crew lined up the aircraft on the runway edge lights along the right-hand side of runway 27L instead of the runway centreline lights of runway 27L.
This resulted in a misaligned take-off roll over the elevated runway edge lights along the right-hand side of runway 27L leading to damages to the runway edge lights and the aircraft itself.
A combination of environmental, operational, and human factors contributed to the sequence of events:
- Dark night operation
- Reduced visibility
- Runway and taxiway environment, including an extra tarmac width on runway 27L, the absence of runway shoulder markings, the absence of taxiway centreline lighting, and the use of a displaced threshold
- Flight crew divided attention unintentionally provoked by the before take-off procedures and checks
- Flight crew fatigue

The serious incident occurred in dark night and under instrument meteorological conditions (IMC).

One minute after take-off, the crew sensed smoke in the cockpit. The smoke intensity increased and the crew received a low oil pressure warning on engine no.1 (left) in combination with a torque loss of 30%. The cockpit crew donned their oxygen masks and shut down the engine. The crew declared an emergency to ATC due to smoke in cockpit and cabin, and requested an immediate return. The ATCO cleared them for a direct landing and after another four minutes the aircraft landed on runway 11, stopped on the runway and evacuated all 14 passengers and the crew without any injuries.
There was no controllability problems or other technical issues with the aircraft.
One cabin crew had put on her smoke hood, while the other cabin crew attempted to open the smoke hood bag without success. An AIB pull test revealed that 19.03 kg of pull was needed to tear open the protective bag. Opening of a protective breathing equipment (PBE) protective bag was not directly specified as a requirement in neither initial
nor recurrent cabin crew PBE training requirements.
It also appeared that neither cabin crew nor passengers heard the passenger address (PA) announcements made by
the left hand seated pilot. A subsequent test of the interphone/PA system did not reveal any faults.

Factors:
1. Engine no. 1 seized approximately one minute after take-off, most likely due to the failure of the bearing no. 2.
2. The CA 1 was unable to open her PBE protective bag.

18 Feb 2018,ATR 72-212,EP-ATS,Iran Aseman Airlines,66,15 km NE of Yasuj Airport (YES),w/o,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/319724,ATR 72-200,AT72,09:32,391,P&W Canada PW126,Fatalities: 66 / Occupants: 66,0,Accident,En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Tehran-Mehrabad Airport (THR/OIII),Yasuj Airport (YES/OISY),"An ATR 72-200 operating Iran Aseman Airlines flight 3704 from Tehran to Yasuj, Iran, impacted a mountainside in the Mount Dena range to the northeast of Yasuj Airport. All on board were killed.

The flight departed Mehrabad Airport at 08:05 hours local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL210. At 09:22 the aircraft was over the Isfahan (IFN) VOR. The flight requested permission to descend from FL210 to FL170. This was approved by Tehran ACC. The flight followed Airway W114 from the OBTUX navaid to the Yasuj DVOR/DME. Minimum altitude on that airway is FL170. Minimum safe altitude (MSA) over the sector close to Yasuj Airport is 15500 feet.
Weather reported to the crew indicated a cloud ceiling of 15000 feet. Despite their clearance for FL170 and the MSA in the area, the crew subsequently selected FL150 as their target altitude.
The flight levelled off at FL150 at 09:28 hours and the de-ice & anti-ice systems were switched on. Subsequently the flight crew selected the autopilot's altitude mode to FL150. The aircraft then entered a mountain wave with vertical (updraft) winds reaching up to 3000 ft/min with associated icing conditions. Since the autopilot attempted to maintain FL150, engine power reduced to flight idle and the aircraft pitched down -4Â°. In these conditions the speed gradually reduced from a Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) of 205 knots.
At 09:29:44 the flight crew switched off the de-ice & anti-ice systems. The aircraft then entered a mountain wave downdraft. Engine powered increased and the nose pitched up because the autopilot was attempting to get back to FL150. The CAS meanwhile dropped to 130 knots.
The pilot then selected FL140 on the autopilot as the airspeed dropped to 118 knots. The stall warning sounded and the autopilot disconnected automatically. Airspeed increased to 134 knots as the aircraft descended at a rate of -3200 ft/m. At 09:31:22 the flight crew re-engaged the autopilot and set FL150 as their target altitude.
Four seconds later the aircraft became close to the surrounding mountainous terrain and the EGPWS alarm sounded. Radio altitude at that point was 3643 feet (pressure altitude 13869 ft).
The autopilot was disengaged again as the aircraft continued to lose altitude. Unable to regain altitude the flight crew noticed the mountain side ahead rolled the plane -86Â° to the left. The nose pitched up and the aircraft impacted the side of a mountain at 09:31:41.
The wreckage was located the following day in the snow, 350 feet below the top of a 13,412 ft high mountain.

Probable causes (from final report):
The main cause of accident:
The accident was happened due to many chains of considered causes but the 'Human Factor' had main role for the conclusion of the scenario. The Cockpit Crew action which has caused dangerous conditions for the flight is considered as main cause. Based on provided evidences, the errors of cockpit crew were as follows:
- Continuing to the Yasouj airport for landing against Operation manual of the Company, due to low altitude ceiling of the cloud and related cloud mass. They should divert to alternate airport.
- Descending to unauthorized altitude below minimum of the route and MSA
- Lack of enough CRM during flight
- Failure to complete the stall recovery (flap setting, max RPM).
- Inappropriate use of Autopilot after Stall condition
- Inadequate anticipation for bad weather based on OM (Clouds, Turbulence, and Icing ...)
- Quick action to switch off anti-ice system and AOA
- Failure to follow the Check lists and standard call out by both pilots

Contributing Factors:
The contributive factors to this accident include but are not limited to the following:
- the airline was not capable to detect systematic defectives about :
- effectiveness of crew training about Meteorology, OM, SOP, ...
- enough operational supervision on pilot behaviors
- The lack of SIGMET about Mountain Wave or Severe Mountain wave
- Unclear procedure for stall recovery in FCOM
- Lack of warning in aircraft manuals by manufacturer for flight crew awareness about mountain wave.
- Lack of APM System to alert crew about performance degradation

Vibrations lasted less than 1 minute and ceased just before completing turn for final in approach to runway 30.
Except two 1-second engine No. 1 fire warnings during final approach, the crew did not notice any further problems. After an uneventful landing and parking on the apron at Belgrade, the crew conducted a walk-around check of airplane and found that the right/inner cover of the left engine (No. 1) had separated, with most of the cowling missing.
The airport authority conducted a sweep of the runway and surrounding area and did not find any airplane parts or FODs.
On engine No. 1 (left), the lower lock or locks of the right/inner cover of the engine got unlocked or broke-off during maneuvering for landing at Belgrade airport (BEG). The right/inner cover of engine No.2 (right) opened during flight resulting in separation of most of the cover, with light damages to engine systems.

The immediate cause
The investigation established that the immediate cause of this serious accident was the breakage of the cowling lock mechanism on the engine mount, due to vibrations caused by the entry of air current into the engine compartment, which amplified the vibrations caused by the engine, air current flow around the engine nacelle were damaged more than was allowed.
Indirect causes
The indirect cause of a serious accident are certain omissions:
- in maintenance: damage to the vibration insulator of motor number 1 greater than allowed, as well as parts of the engine cover lock mechanism on the engine mount (lugs);
- during the pre-flight inspection of the aircraft by the crew, when a gap should have been noticed between the cowling and the engine nacelle.

There were two pilots and one technician on board. During the landing at TrollhÃ¤ttan/VÃ¤nersborg Airport, which took place with a crosswind from the left, the aircraft came off the runway on the left side, damaged a runway edge light and thereafter rolled back onto the runway.
The runway excursion was not reported by the crew. The damaged edge light and the tyre tracks were discovered by airport personnel, who noted that the tracks could only have been left by the aircraft in question. This was reported to the Swedish Transport Agency and to the operator.

SHK makes the assessment that the incident was caused by the following factors:
- The operator and the pilots had not read ATRâ€™s flight operations information message (FOIM) regarding recommended procedures for crosswind landings.
- The operatorâ€™s pilots lacked full training in crosswind landings on the aircraft model.

Due to the incident, the Latvian civil aviation agency has carried out an inspection of the operator. This has led to a number of recommendations regarding measures for the operator to take, for example regarding reporting culture, risk assessments and training initiatives.
The type certificate holder of the aircraft has decided to introduce supplementary information on crosswind landings in the aircraft FCOM, in order to recall basic pilot training technique for crosswind landing. The operator has introduced a number of training measures to improve safety in conjunction with crosswind landings on the aircraft type.

Aircraft scheduled maintenance was performed in the period between the first flight and the serious incident flight.
After engine start and during taxi to the departure runway, the right hand engine air conditioning pack valve caution triggered. The flight crew reset the pack valve and normal operation was resumed.
Following take off from runway 22R, when passing an altitude of 500 feet mean sea level (msl), the flight crew set engine climb power.
Shortly after and approaching approximately 1000 feet msl, the flight crew sensed a chemical or electrical smell in the cockpit.
The first officer perceived smoke (..it looks misty..) in the commander foot well area, but the commander did not observe any smoke.
The flight crew donned oxygen masks and declared an emergency, requesting a diversion back to EKCH.
Air traffic control issued left hand radar vectors to runway 30.
While the first officer flew the aircraft, the commander performed the SMOKE and the ELECTRICAL SMOKE emergency checklists.
Through intercom communication, the commander informed the cabin crew of the situation. The cabin crew informed the commander that they could sense a smell, but could not see any smoke.
At this time, there was no visible smoke in the cockpit.
Due to the perceived low intensity of the smell, the cabin crew decided not to put on their protective breathing equipment (smoke hood).
Within a few minutes, the aircraft landed on runway 30 and turned onto taxiway B in order to assess whether to evacuate the aircraft.
Since smoke was neither visible in the cockpit nor in the cabin, and the smell was only light in intensity, the commander decided to taxi the aircraft to the assigned parking stand and disembark the passengers by normal procedure through the aircraft entrance door.
The crew did not observe any ELEC SMOKE warning during the serious incident flight.


It has not been possible for the AIB to identify definitively the source of the perceived smoke or smell in the aircraft/cockpit.
The oil consumption log did not indicate any unusual oil consumption of either engine, but it is possible, following the oil refill that a small amount of excess or spilled engine oil produced the perceived smoke or smell vented through the air conditioning system.

16 Sep 2019,ATR 72-202,PR-MPY,MAP Linhas Aéreas,0,"Itaituba Airport, PA (ITB/SBIH)",non,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/229428,ATR 72-200,AT72,c. 20:35 UTC,519,P&W Canada PW124B,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 43,0,Serious incident,Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,"Itaituba Airport, PA (ITB/SBIH)","Manaus-Eduardo Gomes International Airport, AM (MAO/SBEG)","Having been accommodated in a hotel in Belem overnight, both pilots reported for duty at Belem airport in mid-morning. They were to operate scheduled passenger flights from Belem to Manaus and back to Belem with intermediate stops in both directions at Altamira and Itaituba. Sufficient fuel was loaded for the Belem-to-Altamira sector, and the flight was completed without event. Once there, having received the flight despatch document prescribing the minimum fuel required for the next sector, the captain arranged for and supervised the uplift of what he believed would be sufficient fuel to reach Manaus without further refuelling at Itaituba. He was aware that although fuel was available at Itaituba if required, there were no ground personnel there to support any requested refuelling.

Once on the ground at Itaituba, it was found that the fuel used for the Altamira-Itaituba sector had been 20% greater than expected - 778kg instead of the forecast 644kg which left a recorded 2,022 kg in tanks. The flight despatch document for the Itaituba departure, which the captain was presented with and signed, showed a minimum fuel required of 2,116 kg but no fuel uplift occurred. It was not possible to determine whether the pilots had â€œnot noticed or disregarded the difference between the prescribed minimum departure fuel and the indicated fuel on boardâ€.

The flight departed for Manaus but whilst en route, Air Traffic Control (ATC) advised that Manaus had been closed because of an aircraft accident with no estimate of when it might reopen. The captain initially instructed the first officer to reduce speed and remain at FL180, but a few minutes later, when icing conditions were suspected, a descent to FL160 was made. When the lack of information on any reopening of Manaus continued, the decision was made to divert. Fuel remaining shown on the fuel quantity indicating system (FQIS) indicated that sufficient fuel was available to divert to the designated alternate, TefÃ©. But the captain considered that returning to Itaituba might be a better option since it was not only slightly nearer (253 nm instead of 281nm) but the weather conditions were known to the crew. Proceeding to TefÃ© would mean continuing westwards beyond Manaus, and after contacting company operations, this was approved. After 25 minutes holding, the diversion was commenced by climbing to FL190.

The pilotsâ€™ recollection was that the CAP FUEL caution, which is activated when the fuel remaining in a main (wing) fuel tank according to the FQIS is less than 160 kg and a low fuel light is illuminated, was present for â€œsome timeâ€ during the flight back to Itaituba before going out. However, recorded data showed that this had actually occurred whilst in a turn during the Manaus hold at FL 160. The same data source also showed that three other brief CAP FUEL activations had then occurred whilst the flight was still level at FL190 during the return to Itaituba. The first two occurred within six minutes of each other midway between Manaus and Itaituba at FL190, and the third ten minutes later with 85nm to go.

Twenty-one minutes later, when only 3.3 nm from Itaituba, a fifth CAP FUEL activation occurred as the left engine power dropped, and 15 seconds later, this engine failed at a recorded 1,446 feet agl. The first officer continued visual positioning via left base to final for runway 05, and a single engine touchdown was completed without further event. As the speed on the landing roll decreased through 70 knots, the captain took control to prepare for the 180Â° turn and backtrack necessary to clear the runway. Whilst this was occurring, the right engine also ran down. A restart attempt of this engine was successful and enabled the captain to complete the taxi to the allocated parking position where the engine was shut down and the passengers disembarked. The pilots stated that only when the successful restart of the right engine had occurred did the right side â€˜LO LVLâ€™ light on the FQIS illuminate. The (external) magnetic fuel level indicators (MFLIs) were used to check the actual useable fuel in tanks, and this was found to be zero in both cases despite the FQIS indication that 410 kg remained.

Contributing factors

Attention â€“ undetermined.

Due to the multiple tasks performed by the pilots while on the ground in SBIH, there was possibly a reduction in their process of attention, which may have caused lapses related to automatic processes, and distractions concerning the amount of fuel required for starting operations in SBIH, since the PIC signed the flight dispatch, which contained the minimum fuel requirements.

Crew Resource Management â€“ a contributor.

There was inefficiency in the utilization of the human resources available for the operation of the aircraft, due to an inappropriate management of the tasks assigned to each pilot, considering their inobservance of the minimum fuel required for starting operations in SBIH.

Aircraft maintenance â€“ a contributor.

After the occurrence of the serious incident, and upon completion of the aircraft repair work, the fuel quantity indicator of the PR-MPY resumed proper operation anew, evidencing that the FQI components had problems that interfered directly with the fuel system indication. Thus, one verified the non-conformity of the maintenance services previously performed on the aircraft, independently of having been preventive or corrective, since the PR-MPY had remained with a system failure that contributed to the serious incident.

Support personnel â€“ undetermined.

The fact that there was no support staff at SBIH to perform post-flight, pre-flight and refueling tasks may have strongly increased the pilotsâ€™ workload, which may have resulted in possible distraction as to the need of refueling the aircraft.

Organizational processes â€“ undetermined.

One cannot rule out the possible contribution of the company's organizational support, since, despite the fact that MAP Linhas AÃ©reas Ltda. possessed its own team of mechanics, it was actually Manaus AerotÃ¡xi the company responsible for the maintenance of the aircraft, since MAP Linhas AÃ©reas Ltda did not have certification for the provision of maintenance services. Such state of circumstances may have led to failures in the supervision or, even, in the design of organizational processes important for the preservation of safety.

Managerial oversight â€“ a contributor.

In view of the various non-conformities observed in the components of the fuel indication system after the occurrence, one inferred that there were failures in the monitoring and oversight of the maintenance services of the operating company.

The crew performed right turn with visual to the runway 30. After taxiing to stand 37, the crew turned off both engines and turned off all electricity using the QRH procedure.

The cause of the smoke was damage to the avionics fan system.

Based on the analysis of the incident, the Commission considers that the crew's actions were timely and coordinated with the air traffic controller. The return of the aircraft to the departure aerodrome was carried out immediately after take-off and in VMC conditions that were appropriate at the time of the incident. Any continuation of the flight could have had a negative impact on the safety of the aircraft and consequently the crew and cargo.
The Board is of the opinion that, given the circumstances of the incident, the crew's awareness of the aircraft's position after departure, the traffic conditions at the departure aerodrome and other information on flight elements such as altitude, speed, engine operating parameters, external and internal visibility, radio communication response with the controller, the crew carried out, in a short but sufficient time, all the procedures specified by the manufacturer of the ATR, taking into account the principles of the CRM & TEM, for this type of occurrence of odour and smoke in the cabin of the aeroplane.

This caused the loss of the co-pilotâ€™s flight instrument displays and triggered a number of warnings and cautions. The crew executed a go-around and diverted to Birmingham International Airport.

The aircraft remained on the ground for a week and returned to service on January 25th 2023.

Conclusion
A wiring defect on the DC Gen 2 speed sensor resulted in rapidly changing erroneous signals being sent to the GCU. This resulted in the rapid opening and closing of contactor 23PA in response to these inputs and, due to the rapidly fluctuating conditions, the BTC entered a self-protection mode and remained open for the remainder of the flight.
As a consequence of the above, the crew lost a significant number of instruments and systems during the final phases of a CAT II approach in reduced visibility at night. The power distribution anomalies also resulted in a number of spurious and potentially distracting EGPWS aural alerts. The crew conducted a go-around and, following a temporary loss of
communications and permanent loss of autoflight capability, manually flew the aircraft to Birmingham Airport where it landed without further incident.
The wiring defect was probably caused by incorrect use of wire stripping tools at the third-party organisation that had overhauled the starter-generator.
The starter-generator manufacturer and the overhaul organisation have identified a number of safety actions they intend to take to prevent a reoccurrence.

7 Mar 2023,ATR 72-202 (F),G-NPTF,West Atlantic UK,0,Belfast International Airport (BFS/EGAA),non,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/309308,ATR 72-200,AT72,01:38 UTC,192,P&W Canada PW124B,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 2,0,Serious incident,En route,Cargo,East Midlands Airport (EMA/EGNX),Belfast International Airport (BFS/EGAA),"West Atlantic flight NPT07B , an ATR-72-202F, was landing on runway 25 at Belfast International Airport (BFS) when during the landing flare the flight crew encountered a rudder control restriction. They used nosewheel steering for directional control on the runway.
Examination of the aircraft the following day revealed that the rudder was almost immoveable, either using the rudder pedals in the cockpit or by physically pressing on the rudder itself.

AAIB Conclusion
Following an extensive history of reports of stiffness within the rudder control system, the flight crew experienced rudder stiffness during the full and free control check prior to the flight. Aware of the recent maintenance interventions which were considered to have resolved the problem, the flight crew elected to continue with the flight. They subsequently encountered excessive rudder stiffness during the landing flare which rendered the rudder
pedals almost immovable.
Two support bearings on the rudder rear quadrant shaft were found to be corroded. Trapped moisture in the aircraftâ€™s rear bay probably contributed to the condition of the bearings.
Unable to rotate freely, the bearings would have resisted the movement of the rudder rear quadrant shaft leading to the stiffness. Other anomalies observed in the rudder control system may have contributed to the stiffness, but to a lesser extent.
A Service Bulletin published in 1993 existed to replace the affected bearings with corrosion-resistant equivalents, but had not been embodied on G-NPTF. In February 2024 the manufacturer updated the IPD to allow interchangeability for some flight control bearings (including those on the rudder rear quadrant) with corrosion-resistant bearings, as an
alternative to the Service Bulletin.
The manufacturer will also issue an operator communication emphasising existing operational and maintenance procedures to prevent reoccurrence.

THE AIRPLANE RETURNED TO THE AIRPORT, AND THE DOOR SEPARATED FROM THE AIRPLANE WHILE IT WAS ON FINAL APPROACH. ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE DOOR WAS CLOSED AND LOCKED PRIOR TO TAKEOFF. THE LACK OF DAMAGE INDICATES THE DOOR WAS UNLOCKED/UNLATCHED WHEN IT OPENED. THE AIRPLANE HAD A NEWLY DESIGNED HANDRAIL/DOOR HANDLE INSTALLED WHICH REVERSED THE DIRECTION OF MOTION TO LOCK AND UNLOCK THE DOOR. FOURTEEN AIRPLANES IN THE FLEET INCORPORATED THIS DESIGN.

While climbing through 7500 feet, the fire warning system activated. The flight crew extinguished the fire, secured the engine, and returned to the departure airport. Examination of the engine revealed that a fuel leak had occurred at the #7 and #8 fuel manifold nozzle transfer tubes. The fuel manifold transfer tube locking plates for the #7 and #8 nozzle assemblies were found improperly installed, and the respective 'O' rings were found to be cut and scratched. Also, the engine's overboard (fuel/oil) drain line was found to be about 99% blocked with a carbon-like material. Additionally, the engine's fuel manifold and turbine support case drain lines were noted to be positioned directly opposite each other within the drain manifold. The drain line's turbine support case fitting had an oversized and offset, crush gasket. The nacelle's interior had a flame discolored area directly below this fitting.

Probable Cause: improper installation of the #7 and #8 fuel nozzle manifold transfer tubes by company maintenance personnel, and an inadequate exhaust drain fitting gasket, which resulted in fuel leaks at the respective 'O' ring/gasket fittings; blockage of the fuel/oil drain manifold; and subsequent fire in the engine compartment.

The crew was informed by company maintenance personnel that they might be experiencing a possible fuel nozzle leak on that engine. The #1 engine fire warning light illuminated, and the fire horn activated. The captain secured the engine and discharged the #1 fire suppression agent. Immediately following the discharge, the associated warning lights on the fire handle and condition lever extinguished. An uneventful single engine landing was completed and the passengers deplaned without further incident. Evidence of thermal damage was found in the aft section of the engine in the area of the lower turbine support case. Examination of the system revealed that 3 of the 144 'O' rings associated with the 14-nozzle fuel system were deteriorated or damaged. Also, during the investigation, testing at the engine manufacturer's facility revealed that the inside diameter of the copper gasket used at the fuel drain nipple was 30 to 40% larger than required. This resulted in misalignment and a leak at the fitting.

Probable Cause: 'O' ring failure in the fuel line to the left engine nozzle assemblies, which resulted in a fuel line leak and a left engine compartment fire.

Hobby Airport, TX (HOU/KHOU)",(KDFW),"The ATR-72-12 transport airplane was at 5,000 feet MSL when the #2 engine fire warning light illuminated. After shutting down the #2 engine and actuating the fire extinguishing system, the crew executed a single engine landing followed by a normal taxi to the ramp and normal passenger debarkation. Inspection of the P&W 127 series engine showed that a fuel transfer tube adjacent to the #2 nozzle was misaligned and 'backed out' of its retaining clip. Fuel streaking and fire damage were evident down the right side of the engine from the #2 nozzle downward along the fuel nozzle ring assembly. The incident occurred 3.4 hours after the fuel nozzles, retaining clips, and transfer tubes were replaced during maintenance on the #2 engine. The engine manufacturer had published several service bulletins addressing the potential of incorrectly installing the retaining clips and recommending that existing clips be replaced with stronger lock plates that provide a positive locking mechanism to avoid misalignment during installation. The manufacturer issued a Service Bulletin in October 1994 and Transport Canada issued an AD in November 1996, both citing how the retaining clips could be installed 'out of position' and recommending that operators use the newer lock plate. The FAA had published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on July 17, 1995, addressing the aforementioned issues. FAA AD 98-14-02 was published in the Federal Register on July 1, 1998. The AD was similar to the Canadian AD issued on November 19, 1996.

Probable Cause: the engine fire during descent resulting from a loose, leaking fuel transfer tube due to improper installation and alignment of the transfer tube's retaining clip. Contributing factors were the inadequate design of the clamp, the failure of the operator to comply with the recommendations of the manufacturer's Service Bulletin (SB), and the failure of the FAA to issue an Airworthiness Directive to mandate the manufacturer's SB.

About 3 minutes later the crew received a TCAS (traffic collision avoidance system) alert to climb. The flight climbed from 4,000 feet and leveled off at 5,300 feet. During the climb both flight attendants fell. One flight attendant broke her leg, the other was not injured. The flight attendants were standing completing their pre-landing duties when the event occurred. The pilot radioed ATC that he needed to have an ambulance meet the flight when it landed. The flight landed without further incident, and the flight attendant was taken to a local hospital.

Probable Cause: an abrupt maneuver in response to a traffic avoidance system alert, resulting in a flight attendant falling and breaking a leg.

The seat belt sign was 'ON' and the flight attendants were performing pre-landing duties. One of the flight attendants broke a bone during the turbulence event. The captain was not informed about the injured flight attendant until he walked to the back of the aircraft after arriving at the gate. According to the injured flight attendant (F/A-A), she was briefed '...only [that it]...would be a little rough getting out of Atlanta, but once we got up everything would be ok...no warning from the cockpit at all of rough air/turbulence' Both flight attendants were knocked to the floor to a sitting position, and both said the turbulence didn't stop. The injured flight attendant said, 'I...was knocked to the floor over and over...up into the service door and the passenger door; my head hit the steps and ended up on the floor flat down...I stayed on the floor...no bells were given when the aircraft was descending...the only 4 bells I heard was at landing time. Also no announcements from [the] cockpit was made when descending through 10,000 feet to the passengers because we were in 0.75 moderate turbulence at the time.' SIGMET [significant metrological] November 2, and AIRMET (Airmen Meteorological Information Network) Tango update 3, calling for a large area of moderate turbulence below 12,000 feet, were current and applicable to the flight's descent into Ashville. The company verified that both the SIGMET and AIRMET were part of the captain's weather briefing, and he had them both in his possession before departure.

Probable Cause: the flight encountered forecasted turbulence, which resulted in serious injury to a flight attendant. Factors in this accident were; the captain's inadequate briefing to the cabin crew; and the insufficient information about the known turbulence that would be encountered during descent.

The captain was the nonflying pilot for the flight, and the first officer was the flying pilot. The takeoff, climb, and en route portions of the flight were uneventful. At 14:37, as the flight approached the San Juan traffic area, the ATIS reported that winds were 060 degrees at 17 knots and gusting at 23 knots. Shortly thereafter, the captain briefed a Vref (the minimum approach airspeed in the landing configuration before the airplane reaches the runway threshold) of 95 knots and told the first officer to ""stand by for winds."" At 14:43 SJU Terminal Radar Approach Control cautioned the pilots of possible wake turbulence from a preceding Boeing. The captain told the first officer to slow down to about 140 kts. At 14:46, the local controller cleared the airplane to land on runway 08. The first officer turned the airplane left toward runway 08 and transitioned to the visual approach slope indicator. At 14:49, the captain stated, ""you better keep that nose down or get some power up because you're gonna balloon."" The airplane descended below the glideslope, causing a GPWS ""glideslope"" alert. The airplane was about 45 feet above ground level and traveling at 110 knots indicated airspeed when it crossed the runway 08 threshold. After the airplane crossed the runway threshold, the captain stated, ""power in a little bit, don't pull the nose up, don't pull the nose up."" At 14:49:39, the captain stated, ""you're ballooning,"" and the first officer replied, ""all right.""
The airplane touched down for the first time about 14:49:41 and about 1,600 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold with vertical and lateral loads of about 1.3 Gs and -0.10 G, respectively. Upon touchdown the captain stated, ""get the power,"" and, 1 second later, ""my aircraft."" The first officer responded, ""your airplane."" The airplane had skipped to an altitude of about 4 feet and touched down again two seconds later about 2,200 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold. The airplane then pitched up to an angle of 9Â° while climbing to an altitude of 37 feet and the engine torque increased from 10 to 43 percent. About 14:49:49, the pitch angle decreased to -3Â°, and the engine torque started to decrease to 20 percent with the pitch angle decreasing to -10Â°. The airplane touched down a third time about 14:49:51 at a bank angle of 7Â° left wing down and about 3,300 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold and with vertical and lateral loads of about 5 Gs and 0.85 G. The ATR pitched up again to 24 feet and landed a fourth time about 14:49:56 (about 15 seconds after the initial touchdown) and about 4,000 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold. This time the airplane pitched down to -7Â° and that it was banked 29Â° left wing down. The airplane came to a complete stop on a grassy area about 217 feet left of the runway centerline and about 4,317 feet beyond the runway threshold.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the captainÂ’s failure to execute proper techniques to recover from the bounced landings and his subsequent failure to execute a go-around.""

After initiated the descent the airplane entered a broken layer of clouds, encountering light turbulence, followed by a momentary ""jolt"" of turbulence. As the airplane encountered the momentary ""jolt"", both flight attendants who were walking to their seats, and one passenger, who had been in the lavatory, were thrown and received injuries. Both the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder were sent to the NTSB's Recorder Laboratory for readout, and when examined was found to contain information related to the turbulence event. The information showed that the Captain had both provided verbal warning of potential turbulence and had activated the fasten seatbelt sign well in advance of the turbulence event.

Probable Cause: In-flight encounter with turbulence that resulted in injuries to a flight attendant and a passenger.

After running checklist procedures without success, the flight crew slowed the airplane to 180 knots and were able to regain full control of the elevator. On final approach and after configuring for landing, the elevators again seemed to be jammed. The flight crew conducted a go-around and declared an emergency. During the second approach, with both control columns partially jammed, the flight crew performed a shallow approach to a smooth landing. A postincident examination revealed that brackets holding an elevator stop had fractured, causing the elevator movement to partially jam. The fractures were consistent with fatigue failure and were caused by a combination of improperly installed shim stacks, poor alignment of the L-brackets, and cyclic stresses acting on the lower stop, which were generated by the repeated improper use of the gust lock system.

Probable Cause: A fatigue failure of an elevator stop bracket, which resulted in a partial jam of the elevator control. Contributing to the failure was the improper installation of shim stacks, poor alignment of the brackets, and cyclic stresses acting on the lower stop, generated by the repeated improper use of the gust lock system.

11 Jan 2010,ATR 72-212,N434AT,American Airlines,0,Saint Croix-Henry E. Rohlsen Airport (STX/TISX),min,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/314684,ATR 72-210,AT73,20:00 LT,434,Pratt & Whitney PW127,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 48,0,Serious incident,Take off,Passenger - Scheduled,Saint Croix-Henry E. Rohlsen Airport (STX/TISX),Saint Croix-Henry E. Rohlsen Airport (STX/TISX),"During takeoff the No. 1 (left) engine fire warning illuminated in the cockpit. The pilot declared an emergency, shut down the No. 1 engine and discharged one fire bottle. The fire warning continued and the pilot discharged the second bottle; but the fire warning did not extinguish. The pilot performed an air turnback and landed the airplane uneventfully approximately 11 minutes later.

Engine testing at the manufacturer's facility revealed a large fuel leak emanating from the No. 2 fuel nozzle manifold adapter-to-transfer tube O-ring connection.

Examination revealed two manufacturing defects in the No. 2 fuel nozzle manifold adapter. The first defect, poor surface finish, caused damage to the transfer tube O-ring during the installation process, initiating an internal fuel leak. The second defect, blockage of the internal safety tell-tale drain due to an improper machining and subsequent cleaning procedure, prevented the leaking fuel from flowing into the tell-tale drain and being detected by maintenance personnel.

Examination of the transfer tubes revealed an undersized O-ring retention zone, which allowed the O-ring to fit loosely such that it was not capable of withstanding continuous maximum fuel pressure load. Eventually the O-ring failed to seal properly, fuel leaked and was ignited by the hot combustor case. The undersized O-ring retention zone was created during the cleaning and overhaul process of the transfer tube.

Probable Cause: The sealing failure between the fuel nozzle adapter assembly and fuel transfer tubes that allowed fuel to leak into the nacelle fire zone where it was subsequently ignited by the hot combustor case. Contributing to the failure was a combination of manufacturing defects of the fuel nozzle adapter assembly by the manufacturer and incorrectly overhauled fuel transfer tubes by the engine manufacturer. Contributing to the incident was a second defect of the fuel nozzle adapter assembly by the manufacturer which prevented maintenance personnel from detecting the internal fuel leak.

The airplane operated on a domestic flight from BelÃ©m/Val-de-CÃ£es International Airport. The approach for landing was visual and stabilized. The touchdown on runway 25 was smooth, with gradual deceleration, in which only ground idle power was utilized.
After the 70kt callout, a strong noise was heard, and the left main gear collapsed, with the aircraft veering off to the left. The aircraft exited the runway and came to a stop in a grass area.

1.2.2 Psychosocial information
Nil.
1.2.3 Organizational information
a) Capacitation - a contributor
The lack of capacitation and training of the subcontractorsÂ’ professionals for handling aircraft material hindered the execution of an efficient maintenance work as prescribed by the manufacturer's manual, culminating in inadequate machining during the maintenance process.
b) Organizational Processes - a contributor
The lack of an effective process of supervision, both on the part of TRIP Linhas AÃ©reas and on the part of the other contractors and subcontractors allowed the existing maintenance servicesÂ’ latent failures not to be checked and corrected, in a way capable of subsidizing, in an adequate and safe manner, the execution of the landing gear maintenance service
The process of supervision of the TRIP Linhas AÃ©reas and the AV IndÃºstria AeronÃ¡utica Ltda. companies by the Civil Aviation Authority, prescribed by specific legislation in force, was not enough to mitigate the latent conditions present in the accident in question.
2 Operational Factor
2.1 Concerning the operation of the aircraft
a) Aircraft maintenance - a contributor
According to the technical opinion issued by the DCTA, the AFT PIVOT PIN (D61000 and SN 25) presented fracture surfaces with Â± 45Âº inclination, as well as a flat area with multiple initiations, indicative of a fracture mechanism related to fatigue.
In examinations of the external surface of the pin, in a region close to the fatigue fracture, cracks were observed that had initiated from scratches created by an inadequate maintenance machining process.
In the region where the overload-related fracture occurred, it was also possible to identify that the machining process had modified the profile of the part in the section transition region, by producing a depression. Thus, it can be said that the AFT PIVOT PIN (D61000 and SN 25) of the PR-TTI left main gear broke on account of fatigue, whose onset was facilitated by an inadequate machining process that had been performed in the section transition region of the pin.

There were 21 passengers and five crew members on board. No one was injured.
The aircraft carried out a round trip from Shannon (SNN), Ireland to Manchester Airport (MAN), U.K. on behalf of Aer Lingus Regional. The return leg, Flight EI 6305, departed Manchester at 08:47. En-route operations were normal and, in consultation with ATC, the aircraft descended and was cleared to self-position to the DERAG waypoint for an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach to runway 24.
At 10:08 hrs the aircraft commenced an approach to runway 24 in strong and gusty crosswind conditions. Following a turbulent approach difficulty was experienced in landing the aircraft, which contacted the runway in a nose-down attitude and bounced. A go-around was performed and the aircraft was vectored for a second approach. During this second approach landing turbulence was again experienced. Following bounces the aircraft pitched nose down and contacted the runway heavily in a nose down attitude. The nose gear collapsed and the aircraft nose descended onto the runway. The aircraft sustained damage with directional control being lost. The aircraft came to rest at the junction of the runway and a taxiway.
Following engine shutdown the forward cabin crew member advised the cockpit that there was no smoke and that the doors could be opened following which, an evacuation was commenced.

PROBABLE CAUSE:
1. Excessive approach speed and inadequate control of aircraft pitch during a crosswind landing in very blustery conditions.
CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS:
1. Confusing wording in the FCOM that led the crew to compute an excessive wind factor in the determination of Vapp.
2. Incorrect power handling technique while landing.
3. Inexperience of the pilot in command.
4. Inadequate information provided to flight crew regarding crosswind landing techniques.

Flight W9424 was a scheduled service fro Mandalay to Yangon. The copilot was Pilot Flying, while the captain was Pilot Monitoring.
It was raining as the flight approached Yangon with Cumulonimbus clouds at 1500 feet over the airport. When 4 km out, the flight was given landing clearance by ATC: ""Air Bagan 424, wind calm, runway 21, clear to land, caution landing runway wet, after landed vacate via Charlie.""
At decision height (250ft), runway 21 was in sight and runway lightings were seen. The aircraft continued though there was light rain. At about 50 ft, visibility suddenly became poor due to heavy rainfall. So the captain took over control of the aircraft. A few seconds later the aircraft made a hard landing, skidded and veered off the left side of the runway onto muddy ground. It came to
rest about 2800ft from the threshold and 75ft from the runway edge.

The copilot radioed a distress message, but did not use standard phraseology. The ATC controller did not appear to understand the message and was not able to give definite information and instruction to the Airport Fire Station to respond to the emergency. Therefore, the aircraft rescue and fire fighters reached the accident site after about 8 minutes.

Primary Cause
During the final landing phase, the pilot was reluctant to perform a go-around while the plane was unstable and of bounce landing in low visibility condition.
Contributing Factors
a) The visibility was very low and the runway centerline lightings were not able to be seen intermittently.
b) The runway was wet and it was raining heavily.
c) The pilot in command took over the control of the plane from the copilot (14) seconds just before the first impact.

After engine start-up, the crew received the following instruction from Cologne/Bonn Ground: ""[...] taxi via Tango hold short 06."" At 03:53:28 hours at taxi-holding position of runway 06 they received the following instruction from Cologne/Bonn Tower: ""[...] backtrack and line up runway 06."" The crew taxied the airplane on the centreline of runway 24 towards the turnpad (paved area next to the runway for turning) for runway 06. According to the Pilot in Commandâ€™s (PIC) statement, he controlled the airplane with his left hand via the Tiller (nose wheel hand steering). According to the CVR recording, the Before Take-off Checklist was completed during taxi. Once the turnpad was reached the airplane initially followed the yellow taxi guidance lines for turning. The airplane turned left abreast of the intersection with taxiway Bravo.
According to the CVR, a sound was heard in the cockpit during the left-hand turn. The crew tried to identify the cause of the sound. Initially, the crew assumed that the cockpit door had opened, but then determined that the PICâ€™s bag had fallen down behind the seat.
The PIC completed the turn and aligned the airplane with the white lights in front of him. The crew waited for take-off clearance because other aircraft were taking off from the crossing runway 32R. According to their statements, both pilots were sure that the airplane was standing on the centreline of runway 06, correctly aligned. At 03:56:13 hrs the crew received take-off clearance: ""[...] wind one hundred 5 kt runway 06 cleared for takeoff [...].""
The crew began take-off run. The PIC controlled the nose landing gear with the Tiller and pushed the power levers. After a short acceleration phase the crew observed several blows to the airplane. They saw objects flying off, but could not identify them. The PIC aborted take-off. The co-pilot was not informed concerning this matter. After a short discussion the crew taxied back via taxiway Tango to their assigned parking position. The crew could not explain the blows and sounds.
The subsequent runway inspection showed that a total of 9 lamps of the left runway edge lighting had been torn off or destroyed and one taxiway lamp was damaged.
After engine shut-off, the crew determined damage in the area of the nose landing gear, below the fuselage close to the main landing gear and on individual propeller blades.


Conclusions:
The Serious Incident occurred because the crew confused the left runway edge marking and lighting of runway 06 of Cologne/Bonn Airport with the centre line and therefore had aligned the airplane unnoticed with the wrong runway lighting for takeoff.
Contributing factors:
- Low attention level of the crew
- Distraction in the cockpit during the turn on the turnpad.
- The width and marking in the area of turnpad and the beginning of runway 06.
- From the cockpit it was difficult to differentiate between runway edge lighting and centre line lighting.

25 Oct 2022,ATR 72-211,G-CLNK,West Atlantic UK,0,East Midlands Airport (EMA/EGNX),min,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/376550,ATR 72-210,AT73,21:30,147,P&W Canada PW127,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 3,0,Serious incident,Landing,Cargo,"Jersey-States Airport, Channel Islands (JER/EGJJ)",East Midlands Airport (EMA/EGNX),"ATR-72-211 G-CLNK sustained minor damage to the nosewheel in a runway excursion at East Midlands Airport.

G-CLNK was operating from Jersey Airport to East Midlands Airport and made a radar vectored autopilot coupled approach to Runway 09. During the approach, the reported wind at the airport obtained by the pilots was from 150Â° at 10 kt. The commander was PF (Pilot Flying).

He stabilised the approach by 1,000 ft and then established the aircraft with a slight crab into wind and power set at 25% torque. In the latter stages of the approach the commander disconnected the autopilot, removed the small amount of crab in the flare and touched down aligned with the runway. Once all wheels were on the runway, he selected ground idle and, as the aircraft continued to decelerate along the runway, it began to swerve to the right.

He handed control to the co-pilot and applied left nosewheel tiller to straighten the aircraft. The commander noticed that the right wing lifted, which he ascribed to the turn to the right in combination with the crosswind from the right. The commander then applied more tiller input to the left, aided by the application of left pedal and differential left brake input by the co-pilot, to which the aircraft slowly began to respond.

During the landing roll the commander reported seeing an object on the runway ahead and to the left. Review of the CCTV subsequently showed a â€˜sparkâ€™ under the aircraft during the landing roll.

The METAR for the airport valid at the time of landing reported wind from 140Â° at 12 kt. The commander reported the excursion to ATC, and a runway inspection was carried out which reported a broken edge light. An engineering inspection found damage to the tyre of the nosewheel, which was replaced.

=AAIB Conclusion=
After landing in a light crosswind, as the aircraft decelerated through 80 kt, it swerved right and hit a runway edge light. The loss of directional control probably occurred because of insufficient in-to-wind aileron. The recovery of directional control was delayed by the use of nosewheel steering through the tiller, rather than the use of rudder.

=Safety actions=
The operator took the following actions:
â€¢ The crew underwent further training in the simulator on the aircraft handling technique in crosswinds during landing.
â€¢ The syllabus for the operator conversion course is being rewritten to maximise crew exposure to crosswinds.
â€¢ The operator advised all involved in training on the ATR 72 to be alert to and monitor for incorrect crosswind techniques or inappropriate use of nosewheel steering through the tiller.

The ATR 72 had descended early and was joining Queenstown under visual flight rules via Kawarau Gorge at low-level in poor weather. Before entering the gorge, the ATR 72 had been advised by air traffic control of a possible requirement to hold at a reporting point on the edge of the control zone. Committed to continue flying through the gorge in deteriorating weather, the ATR 72 was unable to hold at the reporting point when later instructed to. The crew of the ATR 72 had continued through the gorge in the belief that they did not need to obtain an entry clearance into the control zone.

Having entered the control zone the ATR 72 compromised the circling approach of the Boeing 737 that was operating in accordance with normal instrument flight rules procedures. The controller was initially unsure of the location and intended flight path of the Boeing 737, and when both aircraft were established in the zone he was left with little option than to position the ATR 72 in front of the Boeing 737. The captain of the Boeing 737 was then committed to continuing towards the aerodrome in reducing visibility because the ATR 72 had obstructed its primary escape route to the south of the aerodrome.

Safety issues identified were:
* the ATR 72 entering a control zone without an entry clearance
* safety procedures for flying through Kawarau Gorge
* a general poor industry understanding of the requirements for flight under special visual flight rules
* position reporting by aircraft after becoming visual on the instrument approach
* flight under visual flight rules by medium and large air transport aircraft
* poor industry understanding of the management of general aviation areas within the Queenstown Control Zone.

On board were 47 passengers and 2 cabin crew, and 2 pilots and a maintenance engineer on the flight deck. There were no injuries, and no damage to the aeroplane.

Shortly after the captain had landed the aeroplane it was struck by a strong gust, which weathercocked the aeroplane forcefully towards the runway edge. The gust probably exceeded the aeroplane crosswind limit and prevented the captain correcting the weathercock. Consequently, the aeroplane went onto the grass area beside the runway, where it paralleled the runway for about 630 metres before re-entering the runway.

A contributing factor was the reduced effectiveness of the nose wheel steering, because the first officer had not moved the control column far enough forward to ensure there was sufficient weight on the nose wheels.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The Pilot-in-Command in absence of bounce recovery guidance adopted self-perceived technique and kept on adding engine power along with aircraft Pitch manipulations to salvage the aircraft from the bounce on landing, and gravely damaged the aircraft structure."""

At 19:54 hours local time the ATR was stationary at taxi hold point B12 when it was given clearance to enter runway 26L. The clearance was given immediately after an Airbus A320 had commenced its takeoff run on runway 26L. Twenty seconds later, the ATR was cleared for takeoff from runway 26L and confirmed receipt of the message.
Forty seconds later the tower asked the ATR to begin the takeoff run, because otherwise another aircraft then on approach would have to go around. The ATR confirmed the immediate commencement of the takeoff run. Six seconds later the tower instructed the ATR to abort the takeoff: ""[Call sign] disregard departure clearance vacate first high-speed to the right again."" The ATR followed the instruction and was then cleared via taxiway T to return to taxi hold point B14 for runway 26L.
On arrival at hold point B14, the crew noted that the brake temperature indicated was excessive. At 20:02 hrs the tower asked the ATR crew if they were ready for an immediate takeoff, to which they replied in the negative. Seventy seconds later the crew of another aircraft reported by radio: ""[...] Air Dolomiti you are on fire at B14 your left tyre is on fire."" A few seconds later the tower gave the alarm and 59 passengers and four crew members left the aircraft via the rear left door and the front left emergency exit. The fire service reached the aircraft shortly thereafter and extinguished the fire, which by then had spread from the tyre to the undercarriage fairing.
During the evacuation, one female passenger broke her left forearm.

Examination of the left landing gear showed that a brake cylinder on the inner wheel of the left landing gear had ruptured. Two others had been deformed. A thermal analysis determined that normal taxiing to the runway, rejected takeoff, and the taxiing back to the taxi hold point could not heat up the brake to an extent which would cause the found damages.

PROBABLE CAUSE: The investigation report did not contain a probable cause paragraph as recommended in ICAO Annex 13.

Runway 27 thus was available only after runway intersection as runway 27A. To carry out operations on this reduced runway 27 a NOTAM was issued and designated runway 27A for visual approach only.
The weather conditions prevailing at the time of accident was winds 070/07 knots visibility 2800 m with feeble rain. Prior to Kingfisher aircraft, Air India flight IC-164, an Airbus 319 had landed and reported to ATC that it had aquaplaned and broken two runway edge lights. The ATC acknowledged it and sent runway inspection vehicle to inspect the runway. The ATC person was not familiar with the terminology of 'aquaplaning' and not realizing the seriousness of it, cleared the Kingfisher flight for landing. At the time of accident there were water patches on the runway. ATC also did not transmit to the Kingfisher aircraft the information regarding aquaplaning reported by the previous aircraft.
The ATR-72 approached high and fast. The aircraft landed late on the runway and the runway length available was around 1000 m from the touchdown point. In the prevailing weather conditions this runway length was just sufficient to stop the aircraft on the runway. During landing the aircraft aquaplaned and did not decelerate even though reversers and full manual braking was applied by both the cockpit crew. The aircraft started skidding toward the left of center line. On nearing the runway end, the pilot initiated a 45Â° right turn, after crossing Taxiway N10, the aircraft rolled into an unpaved wet area. It rolled over drainage pipes and finally came to a stop near open drain. There was no fire.

PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT:
The accident occurred due to unstabilized approach and decision of crew not to carry out a 'Go-around'.
Contributory Factors:
i) Water patches on the R/w 27A
ii) Inability of the ATCO to communicate the aircraft about aquaplaning of the previous aircraft
iii) Lack of input from the co-pilot.

Approximately 35 minutes later, another ATR 72 aeroplane, also flying from Christchurch to Wellington, encountered severe turbulence in the same general area.
Although no injuries or damage resulted from these incidents, the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) decided to inquire into the adequacy of the meteorological information available to the pilots before and during the flights, the operator and flight crew action taken to minimise the risks of severe turbulence encounters, and the processes followed by the providers of air traffic and meteorological services in response to pilot reports of significant weather hazards.
The investigation found that the events might have been avoided or been less severe had the operator had a more robust flight dispatch system, and had the air traffic service complied fully with a requirement to pass flight information to pilots on first contact.

The first officer was the Pilot Flying (PF) while the captain was the Pilot Not Flying (PNF).
Approaching Manila, the flight was under radar vector for a VOR/DME approach to runway 24. At 7 miles on finals the approach was stabilized. A sudden tailwind was experienced by the crew at 500 feet radio altitude (RA) which resulted in an increase in airspeed and vertical speed. The captain took over the controls and continued the approach. Suddenly, the visibility went to zero and consequently the aircraft experienced a bounced landing three times, before a go-around was initiated. During climb out the crew noticed cockpit instruments were affected including both transponders and landing gears. They requested for a priority landing and were vectored and cleared to land on runway 13. After landing the aircraft was taxied to F4 where normal deplaning was carried out. No injuries were reported on the crew and passengers.

PROBABLE CAUSE
The Aircraft Accident Investigation and Inquiry Board determined that the probable cause of this accident was:
- Primary Cause Factor
Failure of the flight crew to discontinue the approach when deteriorating weather and their associated hazards to flight operations had moved into the airport (Human Factor)
- Contributory Factor
The adverse weather condition affected the judgment and decision-making of the PIC even prior to the approach to land. With poor weather conditions being encountered, the PIC still continued the approach and landing. (Environmental Factor)
- Underlying Factor
As a result of the bounced landing, several cockpit instruments were affected including both transponders on board. One of the nosewheels was detached and all the landing gears could not be retracted. Further, the integrity of the structure may have been affected and chance airframe failure was imminent. With all of these conditions, the Captain still opted to request for a priority landing when emergency landing was needed."

The commander was Pilot Non Flying (PNF) and the first officer was Pilot Flying (PF).
Shortly after take-off from runway 22R while climbing through approximately 134 feet Radio Altitude (RA), a cockpit Master Warning was triggered referring to left engine low oil pressure. The cockpit Master Warning was silenced. Subsequently, a cockpit Master Caution was triggered referring to left engine high inner stage turbine temperature (ITT). Visual smoke was present in the cockpit and in the passenger cabin.
The flight crew decided to shut down the left engine (memory items). While climbing through approximately 750 feet RA, a cockpit Master Warning was triggered referring to left engine fire. The cockpit Master Warning was silenced.
A Mayday call to Kastrup Tower was made and the firefighting services of the airport were activated. The commander took over the control of the aircraft (PF) and initiated a left hand visual circling to runway 22L.
The flight crew noted the left engine fire warning lights (red light in the left condition lever and red light in the left fire handle). Engine fire agent number one was discharged.
Engine fire agent number two was discharged and the flight crew decided to land on runway 30 instead of landing on runway 22L.
On final to runway 30, the flight crew advised Kastrup Tower of a coming emergency evacuation of the aircraft on runway 30.
A single engine landing was performed. On runway 30, the flight crew observed that the fire had extinguished and they cancelled the emergency evacuation of the aircraft. The passengers were instructed to calmly disembark the aircraft through the passenger entrance door.
The root cause of the engine failure and engine fire was found to be fatigue crack propagation caused by casting defects (shrinkage porosities) of one of the Power Turbine (PT) stage 1 blades, which led to fracture. The fractured blade caused a lot of fractured PT stage 2 blades and the PT Rotor came in unbalance and broke the bolts holding the Rotor shaft Bearing Housing No 6 & 7 and this caused the housing to rotate. As a result of the rotating bearing housing, all the force was put on the Bearing Housing oil transfer tubes and caused them to break, subsequently leading to an oil leak. The internal oil leak caused a fire. The leaking oil continued out to the bottom of the nacelle and the internal oil fire then spread outsideto the nacelle area.
The technical investigation revealed that this event was not an isolated event. The AIB-DK concluded that at the time of the serious incident, there were unidentified PT1 blades from the same Batch (Heat) in circulation around the world as the fractured PT1 blade - with micro shrinkage porosity.
As a consequence of a Tri-National investigation, five safety recommendations have been made and forwarded to EASA and Transport Canada (TC).

Climb continued till acceleration altitude with one more short Eng1 oil LP indication.
At 1570 ft, when climb sequence was completed and Bleed valves switched on, oil LP indication popped up again while ITT value dropped to zero.
In absence of additional abnormal parameters, the crew believed in a faulty indication, but soon visual and aural warnings notified an Eng 1 fire condition, together with smoke in the cabin.
So, an in-flight engine fire emergency procedure was applied by shutting down the engine and attempting to discharge the extinguisher agent.
An emergency call was made to Firenze APP and the crew stated his intention to come back to the airport to land on runway 05. Approach and landing took place uneventfully and the precautionary fire brigade assistance was
provided when aircraft stopped on Taxiway P. Precautionary evacuation was carried out at that stage due to “HT brake warning light on”.
The investigation highlighted that the “fire or severe mechanical damage” emergency procedures were revised by ATR at least three times in fourteen months (only the month is edited on the revised pages) and introduced with a consistent delay in the AFM owned by the operator, therefore being effective for the crew."

Causes:
The incident analyzed in this report occurred as a result of the aircraft starting to move forward without this movement being noticed by the crew. The aircraft was able to move because the parking brake had been released, without the crew being consciously aware of having done so.
The cause of the incident was the failure of the crew to adhere to procedures.
The low visibility at the time of the event could have contributed to hampering the acquisition of visual references outside the cockpit.

There were 58 passengers and four crew members on board. Six passengers sustained minor injuries.
Lufthansa subsidiary Air Dolomiti operated flight LH1912 from Munich to Venice, Italy. The flight departed at 13:34. Shortly after takeoff smoke was reported in the cabin. The captain decided to return to Munich.
After receiving clearance to descend to FL110, engine power was reduced. At that time the flight crew noted a Master Caution alert and a fire warning for engine no.2. The pilots fired the extinguishing bottle in engine no.2 and proceeded to shut it down.
The descent was continued while the flight crew worked the appropriate checklists.
After landing on runway 26L, the ATR 72 began turning left until it ran off the side of the runway. The airplane went into the grass and came to rest with the nose gear collapsed.

It was found that the engine failure was caused by a broken turbine blade in the second stage of the power turbine [PT-2]. The turbine blade above the root in the area of the wing had fractured due to fatigue fracture followed by residual fracture due to tensile overload.
It was also found that the Travel Limiter Unit (TLU), which limits the travel of the rudder, was in high-speed mode and could only be moved to a limited extent.

Approximately 30 nautical miles north-east of JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping, an airprox occurred with PH-DCI that had taken off from JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping en route to Bromma on a north-easterly heading and that was climbing to Flight Level 150.
During the airprox, there was a separation minima infringement upon which both aircraft's collision warning systems were activated. The crews of both aircraft performed evasive manoeuvres in accordance with the collision warning systems' instructions.
Air traffic control did not clearly perceive the TCAS alarm and attempted to modify the aircraft flight paths.

The minimum vertical distance between the aircraft was 300 feet at a horizontal distance of 3.24 nautical miles (nm). The minimum horizontal distance was 1.75 nm with an altitude difference of 800 feet.


The serious incident was caused by the following factors:
ï‚· The air traffic controller's focus was on an early handover of flights to another sector.
ï‚· Air traffic control's aids for noticing the conflict were not capable of breaking the mental picture that the controller had of the situation in the sector

The Finnish Accident Investigation Board classified this as a serious incident and launched an investigation.

Probable cause and consequence
The serious incident was caused by the mechanically centred rudder’s insufficient authority for directional control, which resulted in the aircraft veering off the runway.
Contributing factors
The rudder’s Travel Limitation Unit (TLU) electric actuator broke and the TLU was left in the high speed (HI SPD) mode for the approach and landing, jamming the rudder.
Due to inadequate system awareness and the fact that the QRH did not clearly enough provide instructions for using the TLU’s standby system, the flight crew did not switch on the TLU’s standby system.
The right engine’s propeller blade angles transitioned sooner into the BETA zone following the reduction of engine power at landing, which resulted in a large directional oscillation.

Of the 50 occupants, five sustained serious injuries.
Alitalia flight 1670 had departed Pisa-Galileo Galilei Airport (PSA) on a domestic flight to Roma-Fiumicino Airport (FCO). This flight was operated by Carpatair on behalf of Alitalia.
The airplane flew the approach in strong cross wind conditions with wind shear reported at runway 16L some fifteen minutes before the landing. Shortly before touchdown the airplane suddenly lost altitude and impacted the runway with the nose landing gear. This was at a distance of 567 meters from the runway threshold.
It bounced three times, causing the nose and main gear to collapse. The airplane slid off the left side of the runway and came to rest in the grass near taxiway DE, at a distance of about 1780 meters from the runway threshold. The aircraft had also performed a rotation on the vertical axis of 170Â°, thus assuming a definitive orientation of about 330Â° magnetic. It came to rest 400 m from fire station no. 1. However, it took the fire services ten minutes to reach the airplane because they were not aware of the precise location of the accident.

The airplane landed in strong winds from 250 degrees on runway 16L. Runway 25 at Fiumicino was Notamed not available for landings due to work in progress.
The Fiumicino Notam reported at the time of the accident of the following limitations of the runway 16L ILS:
- LOCALIZER AT 17NM MRA 3000FT AND AT 25NM MRA 4000FT
- GLIDE PATH COVERAGE REDUCED AT 8.5NM

The ATR 72-212 has a demonstrated maximum crosswind component of 35 kts on a dry runway.

CAUSES: (translated from Italian)
The accident is due to the human factor. In particular, it was caused by an improper conduct of the aircraft by the PF (commander) during landing, not consistent with the provisions of the operator's manuals, in an environmental context characterized by the presence of significant criticality (presence of crosswind with values at the limit/excess those allowed for the ATR 72) and in the absence of an effective CRM.
The following factors may have contributed to the event.
- The failure to carry out the landing briefing, which, in addition to being required by company regulations, would have been an important moment of pooling and acceptance of information fundamental to the safety of operations.
- The maintenance of a V APP significantly higher than expected.
- The conviction of the commander (PF), deriving from his considerable general and specific experience on the aircraft in question, to be able to conduct a safe landing in spite of the presence of critical wind conditions for the type of aircraft.
- The considerable difference in experience between the commander and the first officer, which has reasonably prevented the latter from showing his critical capacity, thus rendering CRM techniques ineffective.
After the accident, the application of the PEA revealed some critical issues, which did not allow to carry out in a timely and effective manner the search and rescue of the aircraft and its occupants.

After landing on runway 14L, the co-pilot transferred the flight controls to the captain. The crew the perceived a noise followed by vibrations coming from the nose gear. At the end of landing roll, as they were about to turn left via the taxiway to the parking area, the captain noticed that the nosewheel steering control was no longer working. He continued braking the aircraft. A noise was again heard at the front and the aircraft came to rest on the runway centreline.

Cause
Uncoupling of the compass from the nose gear is caused by the loss of the retaining pin during rolling on landing.

This loss may be due to :
- incorrect positioning of one of the components of the assembly ;
- weakening of the bolt/nut assembly due to corrosion of the bolt thread and probably the nut.

Two extinguishing bottles were fired by the crew because they received an engine fire warning.
The crew declared an emergency and reported to the controller that they wanted to land on runway 36R, which was being used for takeoffs.
The controller directed an Airbus A319 to taxy off the runway before the ATR was able to perform the emergency landing.

Contributing causes/factors:
The incident involving the aircraft EC-KKQ was caused by the detachment of a blade from turbine no. 2 of the left engine. The vibration likely caused by this malfunction probably led to the rupture of an oil conduit pipe which, when directed towards hot areas of the engine, caused a fire. Incorrect crew resource management (CRM) and the crew's failure to adhere to emergency procedures led to an unintended approach over an active runway designated exclusively for takeoff maneuvers.

The aircraft landed safely at Sung Shan Airport at 16:31. The aircraft had no damage and people on board without injuries.

Finding(s) related to the probable causes:
Hot air was continuously vented from air condition outlet, due to malfunctioning Pack #1 duct temperature sensor and temperature limiter that caused the modulating valve kept opening in the occurrence flight; as a result, temperature in the cockpit remained high. The flight crew did not shut off pack #1 immediately which enabled to stop hot air from continuously flowing into the cockpit.

Although the aircraft anti-icing was activated, the air pneumatic de-icing was not activated by the flight crew. Then, there was a significant degradation of aircraft performance, leading to a reduction in the Indicated Airspeed (IAS).
The aircraft initial cruise speed was 202kt. The aircraft lost 10 kt prior to the activation of anti-icing. The crew heard a noise described as similar to that of a compressor stall, followed by a loud vibration.
The aircraft reached 180 kt when the power levers were reduced to 20% TQ, leading the IAS to reduce down to 148 kt, and the autopilot was disconnected. The crew did not identify the cause of the vibration.
Approximately 4 second after the autopilot was disconnected, the Angle of Attack (AOA) increased, resulting in the activation of the stall protection systems (stick shaker and stick pusher). The pilots counteracted the pusher, which resulted in the loss of aircraft control. During the loss of control, Pitch Uncouping Mechanism (PUM) triggered.
The crew declared emergency and, upon reaching the FL110, the control of the aircraft was restored. Landing was performed in a controlled way at the destination Salvador International Airport, BA (SSA).
The aircraft was not damaged. The 4 crewmembers and 58 passengers left unharmed.

Contributing factors.
- Control skills â€“ a contributor.
The reduction in power in both engines, associated with the attempt to maintain level flight resulted in the decrease of the IAS to values below the minimum operating speed under the conditions encountered; increased angle of attack; and the subsequent activation of stall protection systems.
- Adverse meteorological conditions â€“ a contributor.
The weather conditions observed on the level and route of the PP-PTU, without the aircraft having the de-ice system activated, caused ice accumulation and a significant loss of airspeed. This condition, aggravated by inadequate actuation in flight controls, led the aircraft to a stall condition.
- Crew Resource Management â€“ a contributor.
It was found that there was inefficiency in the use of available human resources for aircraft operation, due to inadequate management of tasks affecting each crewmember because of the confusion in communication, given the misinterpretation regarding the need for engine shutdown during the occurrence.
- Piloting judgment â€“ a contributor.
There was an inadequate assessment by the crew of the parameters related to the operation of the aircraft, regarding the non-activation of the de-icing system for the presented ice formation conditions, as well as regarding the use of flight commands when trying to counteract the stick pusher performance in a stall situation.
- Aircraft maintenance â€“ undetermined.
The absence of the Red Bug from the left-hand speedometer, which was not recorded in the technical logbook, indicated that, at the time of the serious incident, there was no perception by crews and maintenance crews about the importance of observing the minimum operating limits at icing conditions, which may have contributed to this speed limit not being respected in this operation.
- Perception â€“ a contributor.
During the flight, there was an inaccurate perception of the impact of ice accretion conditions on the air operation, which favored the crew to keep the flight in unfavorable conditions and not realize the occurrence of stall caused by ice accumulation.
- Decision-making process â€“ a contributor.
There was an inadequate assessment of the factors that impacted in the aircraft performance, which undermined the recognition of the severe icing condition and resulted in the adoption of wrong measures to manage that adverse situation.

The captain of FVI broadcast on the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF), advising that the aircraft was inbound and planned to conduct a non-directional beacon (NDB) approach, with an estimated arrival time of 1049 overhead the airport. At about 1047, the captain broadcast when 10 NM SE tracking NW to conduct an NDB A approach. At 1049, the captain broadcast tracking outbound in the approach and that they â€œshould be turning straight in for a landing runway 16â€. At about 1050, following the report of a suspected birdstrike by the aircraft just landed, the aerodrome reporting officer (ARO) on duty was in the airport terminal when asked by airport ground staff to conduct a runway inspection. At about 1052 the ARO broadcast on the CTAF advising that the vehicle was preparing to enter the runway for a runway inspection. The ARO then conducted a thorough lookout for aircraft approaching and on the runway with no aircraft sighted. He then broadcast a call entering the runway and commenced driving north along the runway. When at the northern threshold, the vehicle turned and drove south along the runway. The crew of FVI did not hear either broadcast from the ARO. At about 1055, when at about 20 ft above ground level (AGL), the captain looked up out of the cockpit along the runway and sighted the safety vehicle on the white runway aiming point markings near the far end of the runway.

The aircraft departed Pomala Airport at 15:10 LT to Sultan Hasanuddin Airport, Makassar.
The Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Non Flying (PNF).
The pilot elected to fly via MKS VOR to avoid cumulonimbus cloud on the south east area from Makassar. The flight was then vectored for an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach runway 03.
At 1500 feet, the Hasanuddin Tower controller provided the landing clearance with additional information of wind which was from 120Â° up to 23 knots. Considering the experience of the SIC, the PIC took over the control of the aircraft and the SIC performed the duty as PNF.
The PIC noticed that on the right side of the final course was dark and thick cloud, while on the left it was clear.
At 16.00, the aircraft touched down normallyy in the touchdown zone. The pilot started to apply the brake and propeller reverse. The FDR recorded that after touchdown, left rudder was applied gradually from 3Â° up to 27Â° and the aircraft heading varied between 026Â° to 031Â°. The aircraft heading then changed from 030Â° to 074Â°. The aircraft ran off to the right side off the runway. The aircraft skidded and veered to the right and stopped at 15 meters from the runway pavement.
No one injured in this serious incident. The aircraft suffer minor damage mainly on the landing gear doors.


Contributing Factors:
The investigation concluded that the incorrect rudder application to compensate the crosswind affect had resulted in the aircraft exiting the runway. This might due to the pilot confusion to the crosswind effect as result of inadequate training.

The aircraft had landed at Hyderabad at around 10:03 UTC. During taxi, a burning smell along with thick white smoke was observed in cockpit and cabin.
Almost at the same time, the flight crew got an electrical smoke warning in the cockpit. The cockpit crew performed corresponding emergency checklist but the smoke continued to increase both in cockpit and in cabin. As required by the procedure the flight crew carried out engine shut down. The smoke still existed for which the flight crew was unable to identify the source. The passengers were safely evacuated through normal passenger door on Taxiway B4 in coordination with ATC. There were no injuries to any of the occupants.

Cause:
Inadequate air supply across the bearing seal, required for prevention of oil seepage in the airflow, due P2.5/P3 air switching valve being sticky and deteriorated #4 bearing housing resulted in seepage of oil into P2.5 air system causing the oil smell& smoke in the cabin.

The ATR 72-500 had operated two sectors prior to the incident that day with no abnormalities.
The weather at Bengaluru at the time of startup was fine with visibility approx 10 km. The aircraft was scheduled to depart from Bengaluru at around 04:45 UTC. The aircraft was cleared for pushback by ATC, facing east on taxiway L3. Till pushback all the operations were normal. Immediately after push back a NAC OVERHEAT warning came on and as the warning was persisting, engine no. 2 was shut down by the crew. After shutting down the engine no. 2, the NAC OVERHEAT warning disappeared for about 30 seconds.
Subsequently engine no. 1 was started normally. Thereafter pilot asked ground crew for engine no. 2 start. Engine no. 2 was started with prop brake released. Once again the NAC OVERHEAT warning illuminated and it went off after approximately 25 seconds. Thereafter MODE SEL AUTO FAULT was indicated on the Anti/De-icing panel. Then a burning smell was noticed by the crew in the cockpit followed by heavy smoke in the cockpit. The ground crew then asked pilot about the ITT and pilot told ground that ITT went up and then settled. Thereafter the cabin crew also alerted the cockpit crew about the smoke in the cabin.
The cockpit crew then decided to disembark the passengers at same position (L3) and return back to bay. ATC was then informed about the smoke in cockpit and cabin and that the passengers would be deplaned on taxiway L3. ATC was asked to activate the fire services. The pilot then shut down both the engines. Passengers disembarked on L3 normally and the aircraft was towed back to bay 36. There were no injuries to any of the occupant. There was no fire.

Probable Cause of the Incident:
During engine start up, the smoke/ oil smell in the cockpit and cabin was probably caused due to oil leak as a result of wear of inner diameter of the inner valve of the Air Switching Valve thereby imbalancing the secondary seal of bearing compartment.

Flight GE222 had departed from Kaohsiung International Airport (KHH) at 17:43 on a scheduled domestic flight to Magong Airport, Penghu Islands, Taiwan. The flight had been delayed from 16:00 hours because of poor weather as a result of Typhoon Matmo that was passing through the area.
The flight arrived near the Penghu Islands at 18:11 and entered a holding pattern to the northeast. The Magong airport has a single runway 02/20. Runway 02 offers an ILS approach, while for runway 20 a VOR/DME approach is available.
At 18:27 the following weather information was passed on to the crew: runway 02: wind from 210 degrees at 5 knots, gusting to 11 knots; runway 20 wind from 190 degrees at 11 knots, gusting to 15 knots. Visibility was 800 meters.
The crew then requested a runway 02 ILS approach and proceeded towards the south. At 18:43 a preceding UNI Air ATR-72-600, flight 647, requested a VOR approach to runway 20. This probably made the crew change their minds, since they subsequently also requested a VOR approach to runway 20. This was approved. The UNI Air flight landed at 18:56.
At 19:03 the controller cleared the flight to land on runway 20, reporting wind from 250 degrees at 19 knots.
At 19:05:44 the autopilot was disengaged an at about 19:05:58, the aircraft began to deviate to the left, descending below the glidepath. The flight had deviated about 340 m the left of the extended runway centreline when, at 19:06:11, the flight crew reported they were going around. About two seconds later the airplane contacted 5-6 m high trees, cutting a swath for about 100 meters. The airplane remained airborne for about 200 m until impacting a residential area.

According to the Magong Airport flight schedule, 55 out of 66 flights to Magong were cancelled on July 23.

Findings Related to Probable Causes

Flight Operations
1. The flight crew did not comply with the published runway 20 VOR non-precision instrument approach procedures at Magong Airport with respect to the minimum descent altitude (MDA). The captain, as the pilot flying, intentionally descended the aircraft below the published MDA of 330 feet in the instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) without obtaining the required visual references.
2. The aircraft maintained an altitude between 168 and 192 feet before and just after overflying the missed approach point (MAPt). Both pilots spent about 13 seconds attempting to visually locate the runway environment, rather than commencing a missed approach at or prior to the MAPt as required by the published procedures.
3. As the aircraft descended below the minimum descent altitude (MDA), it diverted to the left of the inbound instrument approach track and its rate of descent increased as a result of the flying pilot's control inputs and meteorological conditions. The aircraft's hazardous flight path was not detected and corrected by the crew in due time to avoid the collision with the terrain, suggesting that the crew lost situational awareness about the aircraft's position during the latter stages of the approach.
4. During the final approach, the heavy rain and associated thunderstorm activity intensified producing a maximum rainfall of 1.8 mm per minute. The runway visual range (RVR) subsequently reduced to approximately 500 meters. The degraded visibility significantly reduced the likelihood that the flight crew could have acquired the visual references to the runway environment during the approach.
5. Flight crew coordination, communication, and threat and error management were less than effective. That compromised the safety of the flight. The first officer did not comment about or challenge the fact that the captain had intentionally descended the aircraft below the published minimum descent altitude (MDA). Rather, the first officer collaborated with the captain's intentional descent below the MDA. In addition, the first officer did not detect the aircraft had deviated from the published inbound instrument approach track or identify that those factors increased the risk of a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) event.
6. None of the flight crew recognized the need for a missed approach until the aircraft reached the point (72 feet, 0.5 nautical mile beyond the missed approach point) where collision with the terrain became unavoidable.
7. The aircraft was under the control of the flight crew when it collided with foliage 850 meters northeast of the runway 20 threshold, two seconds after the go around decision had been made. The aircraft sustained significant damage and subsequently collided with buildings in a residential area. Due to the high impact forces and post-impact fire, the crew and most passengers perished.
8. According to the flight recorders data, non-compliance with standard operating procedures (SOPs) was a repeated practice during the occurrence flight. The crew's recurring non-compliance with SOPs constituted an operating culture in which high risk practices were routine and considered normal.
9. The non-compliance with standard operating procedures (SOPs) breached the obstacle clearances of the published procedure, bypassed the safety criteria and risk controls considered in the design of the published procedures, and increased the risk of a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) event.

Weather
10. Magong Airport was affected by the outer rainbands of Typhoon Matmo at the time of the occurrence. The meteorological conditions included thunderstorm activities of heavy rain, significant changes in visibility, and changes in wind direction and speed.

During the descent towards Frankfurt, the flight crew smelled smoke. After asking the cabin crew to investigate the source, the Centralized Crew Alerting System (CCAS) displayed ""ELEC SMOKE"" and ""FWD SMOKE"" warnings. The flight crew then donned their oxygen masks and declared an emergency.
Meanwhile the cabin crew had opened the doors to cargo area in front of the passenger cabin. With the help of passengers they removed luggage in an attempt to locate the source of the smell. After locating the bag, it was brought into the galley where it was cut open. A halon-fire-extinguisher was then used. For the remainder of the flight one cabin crew member remained in the galley to keep an eye on the bag.

At 08:32, while preparing for an ILS approach to runway 25L at Frankfurt Airport, the crew cancelled the emergency. A safe landing was carried out at 08:44. The aircraft taxied to the stand.

An investigation revealed that there had not been an open fire. However, there had been a significant heat development inside the bag.
The source turned out to be one of two 1-liter glass bottles with screw cap, both of which were wrapped with adhesive tape. One of the bottles was broken, leaking the contents into the suitcase. The bottle contained hair bleaching liquid. Why and how this liquid started generating heat is till under investigation."

There were 4 crew members and 38 passengers on board. The aircraft took off at 17:22 and at 17:25 UTC the crew declared emergency using the MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY call due to smoke and fumes entering the flight deck stating in addition the intention to return to Lisbon.
The aircraft was then vectored by the ATC (Lisbon approach) back to RWY03 and crew informed on number of passengers on board, fuel remaining and the request for assistance from the fire services after landing mentioning there would be an attempt to vacate the runway.
The aircraft landed at 17:37 UTC after an uneventful approach and landing, vacated the runway and taxied to the assigned stand being followed by the fire services. After switching off the engines the rest of the operation was coordinated with the fire services. After checking, the captain considered that there were no safety risks involved and asked that the passengers vacate the airplane.
Further on the captain stated that the decision to declare the emergency was due to the smoke with a strong burning smell with no awareness from the source.
The incident did not result in any injuries to passengers and crew.

GPIAA classified this as a serious incident and started an investigation.

Shortly after takeoff, while climbing through 1200 feet, the captain heard a loud bang on the left side of the aircraft.
The nr.1 engine (PW127F) parameters fluctuated and the crew put the left hand engine power lever in the flight idle position. Then the 'Eng No.1 Master Warning' showed up. The crew actioned the “Engine fire at take-off“ emergency checklist and shut down the engine. They then fired both extinguishing bottles.
The ATR-72 aircraft climbed to 3000 feet and the crew worked through all necessary checklists before it was vectored for a landing on runway 07 at Münster-Osnabrück Airport. The controller later cleared the flight for an instrument approach to runway 25.
The aircraft landed safely.
There were no traces of fire on the exterior of the engine. The inside did show traces of fire, along with a broken exhaust pipe."

The aircraft, an ATR-72, climbed to 4000 feet
with a rate of climb of 800 ft/min on true track 184 degrees. The crew then received a clearance to climb to FL190.
Meanwhile, Air Baltic flight BTI34H, a DHC-8-400, departed from the same runway on SID ERIVA 4E and began climbing to 4000 feet on true track 187 degrees. A further clearance was given to climb to FL170.
Initially after departure FCM72TX had high rate of climb but later the climb rate decreased. As a result the distance between both aircraft decreased and the Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA) signal triggered a warning about a potential conflict situation. The APP Controller, who was an instructor, tried to correct the potential conflict and stopped the climb of BTI34H at an altitude of 4000 feet. But due to late intervention and high rate of climb BTI34H stopped only at altitude 4400 feet. Notwithstanding that the SID's for traffic were on different directions, during the turn to the north the longitudinal separation betweeen FCM72TX and BTI34H decreased to less than 3NM and infringement of separation standards occurred. Horizontal distance between aircraft during the conflict was 2.7 NM, vertical 800 feet.


Causes
Proximate Cause:
The APP Controller-Student decision to clear succeeding aircraft BTI-34H to climb to FL170 without climb rate limit;

Root Cause:
The source or origin of an event that played the major role that caused this incident -infringement the separation minima between departing aircraft DH-8D and ATR-72-500 in the TMA was not strict complying the rules prescribed in the Approach Sector Operations Manual by the APP Controller-student, that lead to infringement of separation standards.

Contributing causes:
- Lack of Controller-student experience due to perform On-the-job training and starting initial phase of Practical Part, Sector Executive Position;
- Lack of procedures how to perform hand-over take over/take over of the position;
- Failure of the OJTI to communicate /coordinate Trainee actions in a timely manner;
- Late establishing first contact with APP controller after take-off to the contrary of requirements of the AIP Latvia.;

Primary cause:
The event after which incident became inevitable.
Decision of OJTI not to cancel wrong command by himself immediately upon recognizing studentsâ€™ mistake- wrong command.

The indicated airspeed was 250 knots and the throttles were idle.
The vibrations grew and the commander reduced the rate of descent to 2500 feet per minute.
The vibrations were so strong that the cabin crew had difficulty moving in the cabin and it was difficult to read the instruments in the cockpit.
Information from the flight recorders show that the left propeller was feathered only momentarily. Then the right engine (PW127M) was shut down. The flight continued with the left engine in operation. The information also shows that communication between the pilots did not include confirmation of the engine controls being operated.

When the commander brought the right propeller control to the feathered mode, he could not get it into fuel shut-off mode. The lever was therefore returned to the ""auto"" position, and again via feathering to the off position, the vibrations subsided.
The co-pilot explained the situation to air traffic in Visby tower and declared an emergency.

Causes: Accident Investigation Board has been unable to determine the cause of the serious incident.

There have been six similar incidents. The mechanisms that caused the propeller vibrations have not been determined.

Apparently the crew did not notice this contact and took off from runway 03. The airplane climbed to FL270 until the control tower notified the crew that they had clipped another aircraft.
The flight crew decided to turn back to Yangon for a safety check. A safe landing was made on runway 21 about 00:35 hours local time.
The ATR-72 left hand elevator's leading edge was damaged.

Cause (from final report):
Ground Collision Occurrence (Serious Incident) was due to insufficient clearance between taxiway centre line and the parked aircraft.
There were several contributing factors:
- The airport was congested with 32 aircrafts for 20 parking stands.
- Bangkok Airways ATR72 parking position was not on a proper stand.
- Yangon airport apron management was closed.
- The insufficient lightings, and the dark night did not allow Korean Air pilots to look outside efficiently for obstacle.
- ATC cannot see the apron A because there is a building terminal in between.

The aircraft, after 16 min of flight, stabilized at FL130 in the cruise phase, between Tenerife Norte and Gran Canaria airports, suffered a turbulence that produced a vertical acceleration of 2.54 g that could not be foreseen by the crew.
The ""fasten seat belts"" warning was deactivated at the time of the turbulence and three people were standing in the passenger cabin.
On that day there was an isolated atmospheric depression centered northeast of the Canary Islands whose radius of action fully contained the area between the islands of Gran Canaria and Tenerife. Satellite imagery and pressure maps indicated the presence of abundant convective cloudiness and turbulence in the area.

The investigation has determined that the turbulence was of convective and light origin and that the following factors contributed to the accident:
- the operator's use of a significant map that did not include the forecast of turbulence and icing in the area where the accident occurred,
- the stable atmosphere situation that had occurred during the cruise phases of the three previous flights and during the 7 min prior to the turbulence, in which the flight had been completely stable without any fluctuation in vertical acceleration, and
- the limitation of weather radars to detect certain atmospheric phenomena, such as turbulence, which they are not capable of detecting.

The incident was deemed to be a ""serious incident"" - serious enough to warrant an AAIB Investigation, and the following is the summary from the AAIB Report:

""The aircraft arrived at Manchester Airport from Guernsey and remained on the ground for more than an hour, while it was snowing and the temperature was 0ÂºC. The flight crew decided no de-icing or anti-icing treatment was needed, as they did not consider the snow was settling on the aircraft, and the aircraft subsequently departed to return to Guernsey.

During the takeoff, the commander exerted less aft pressure on the control column, to rotate the aircraft, than he expected and maximum nose-down pitch trim was then needed to maintain the appropriate climb attitude. The autopilot was engaged four times but, on each occasion, it disengaged, as designed, and the commander had to apply continuous forward pressure on the control column to retain the desired pitch attitude, as the climb proceeded.

Once at the cruising level, the commander decided he was having to exert excessive forward pressure on the control column and he elected to divert to East Midlands Airport (EMA). While descending, the aircraft flew out of icing conditions and the control difficulties dissipated. The crew assessed that ice contamination had caused the problem and they made a normal landing.

No ice was found on the aircraft during a post-flight inspection but analysis by the manufacturer concluded that, from the start of the flight until the latter stages of the descent, the airflow over the horizontal tailplane and elevator was disrupted by ice contamination.

=AAIB Conclusion
The investigation concluded that ice contamination affected the tailplane and caused pitch control difficulty after the aircraft rotated, on departure. The evidence indicated that this would have been avoided if the aircraft had been de-iced/anti-iced and then inspected carefully before flight.

The crew considered, before parking, that de-icing was probably going to be unnecessary. It may then have become difficult for them to change their assessment because of â€˜Confirmation biasâ€™, even though they were in freezing conditions and snow was falling. A contributory factor may have been the crewâ€™s lack of experience operating aircraft in such conditions.

The commander optimistically thought that lying snow would blow off the aircraft before rotation; an assessment that was flawed and a possible reflection on the training the pilots had received for such winter conditions. The operator has recognised that recurrent winter training for pilots may have been over-reliant on self-study and has taken remedial action

=Damage sustained to airframe=
Per the AAIB report ""None"". The aircraft was checked over at East Midlands Airport (EMA) and then returned to service

During the initial climb, the crew received a no.2 engine fire warning and shut down the engine.
At 14:12 hours the flight issued a Mayday call, stating their intention to return to land. The Tower controller then offered the flight runway 31R for landing, which was accepted.

Cause of the event
During the safety investigation, the IC concluded that the cause of the incident was that
â€“ a blade of 1st stage PT of the engine №2 fractured as a consequence of a fatigue crack
Factors increasing the risk of a more serious outcome of the incident:
â€“ The flight crew shut off the failed engine with delay.
â€“ The flight lasted longer than the required minimum time.
â€“ The aircraft taxied to the apron without being inspected after landing.

The aircraft took off from runway 27 at Bangalore at 04:29 UTC. The departure from Bangalore was smooth and the aircraft continued to climb. At an altitude of about 4500 feet, the master caution warning was triggered. The crew checked the instruments, however no other abnormality or any other alert was observed. The climb was continued.
A member of the cabin crew noticed white smoke in the cabin and the the flight crew was alerted via interphone.
The captain enquired about the colour, odour and nature of smoke and instructed the cabin crew to try and look out for the source of smoke. Meanwhile the passengers were addressed over the PA system and asked to take a protective breathing position.
The cabin crew members checked but were unable to identify the exact source of smoke. Yet, the smoke kept on intensifying. As the aircraft climbed to 8000 feet, the pilot requested ATC for a holding altitude of 8000 feet. Smoke memo actions were carried out by the crew. After completing the smoke checklist a PAN-PAN call was made to Bangalore ATC and it was informed that aircraft would be returning back. The Unidentified smoke checklist and suspected electrical smoke checklist were then carried out.
At around 04:37 UTC the crew informed Bangalore ATC of the smoke in cockpit and requested shortest vectors to runway. The passengers were informed about the turn back via the PA system and the cabin crew were instructed to prepare for emergency evacuation on the runway. Meanwhile, the smoke kept on getting thicker.
As the cabin crew prepared themselves and aircraft for emergency evacuation, passengers on the starboard side reported seeing flames on the engine.
About 04:48 UTC, the no. 2 engine fire warning came on while on approach at about 1200 feet altitude. After carrying out the in-flight engine fire checklist and severe mechanical damage checklist, the crew issued a MAYDAY call. The fire warning continued after discharging two fire bottles. The fire warning stopped when aircraft was at about 200-100 ft AGL.
The aircraft landed at runway 27 at about 04:53 UTC on a single engine. The crew carried out the evacuation after informing the captain.
The emergency vehicles reached the site immediately and assisted the crew and passengers. After the emergency personnel cleared the aircraft, the aircraft was towed to the stands at 05:13 UTC. Runway operation resumed at 05:21 UTC.

Probable cause of the Incident:
Probable cause of Smoke in cabin was contamination of bleed air by engine oil due to failure of the air/oil seals of turbine shaft bearings and impeller bearings caused by the heavy vibration consequent to failure of PT2 blades.
Not carrying out Eddy Current Inspection as per SI-02-14 or EMM 72-03-00 and SB 21786 was a contributory factor to Serious Incident.

The flight crew reported for a four-sector duty period involving flights from Guernsey to Bristol and return, and Guernsey to Manchester and return. The first two sectors were without incident.
During the turnaround at Guernsey, for the flight to Manchester, the crew had noted that a frontal weather system would be encountered during the flight over the English Channel, with associated cloud, precipitation and moderate icing conditions.

The aircraft took off at 17:18 hrs with a takeoff mass of 21,937 kg. The co-pilot, who had recently qualified on type, was undergoing line training under the supervision of the commander, who was a line training captain. The commander was PF for this sector with the co-pilot PM. Soon after takeoff hi[gh] bank was selected, the autopilot engaged and the aircraft was cleared to climb to FL170. As the aircraft climbed at 170 kt on a northerly track it encountered the weather front and began to accrue airframe icing. Anti-icing systems were activated as the aircraft climbed through 5,300 ft, followed by de-icing systems when actual airframe icing was encountered as the aircraft climbed through FL090. The aircraft was flown at or above the Minimum Icing Speed (this speed, known as the ‘red bug’ speed was 165 kt for the aircraft mass at the time). The crew conducted a review of the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) ‘SEVERE ICING’ procedure’s memory items in the checklist (but not the notes on Detection) in case it became necessary to perform it later.

As the aircraft passed about FL110, degraded perf [ormance] and increase speed caution messages illuminated. Upon switching the external icing light to on, to check the extent of the ice on the ice evidence probe, the commander commented ""…we’ve got a bit [of icing] haven’t we"". The commander made a reference to the QRH checklist for the caution, but it was not actioned; however, he did initially increase the target IAS to 175 kt (red bug +10 kt), during which the rate of climb reduced from 420 ft/min to about 25 ft/min and the caution extinguished.

The commander noted that the aircraft was ""not climbing very well"" and acknowledged that the QRH procedure required an increase in speed to red bug +10 kt but he considered that, as the aircraft was at that moment flying level, it was safe to return the target IAS to 165 kt. This resulted in an increase in the aircraft’s pitch attitude and a climb to the selected level. As he adjusted the speed he commented ""…just see if we can get above [the clouds]."" The autopilot remained engaged in the IAS and heading capture modes.

About one minute later the increase speed caution message illuminated again. At this point the commander commented ""we are picking up quite a bit of ice actually"", later adding that it was the first time he had encountered this [deterioration in climb performance]. At this point the aircraft’s rate of climb was about 200 ft/min. The target IAS was again increased to 175 kt. To achieve this the aircraft initially descended, achieving a maximum rate of -540 ft min and descending almost to FL120, where the aircraft levelled off momentarily.

The target IAS was then reduced back to 165 kt, which initiated a further climb. As it was apparent that the aircraft had insufficient performance to reach its cruising level of FL170, the crew made a request to ATC to level off at FL130 so the aircraft could accelerate, before resuming the climb. ATC approved this and instructed the crew to proceed direct to reporting point NORRY, a change in heading of about 10°. This was achieved by re-programming of the Multifunction Control Display Unit and selecting l/nav. The aircraft experienced an in-flight upset as it levelled off and turned towards NORRY. The autopilot had been engaged throughout the climb until that moment.

Recorded data showed that at the point of the upset the aircraft initially rolled left to 32° the autopilot disengaged, before rolling right to 38°. It then rolled left again, reaching attitudes of 73° in roll and 16° nose-down in pitch.

Upon the commander’s instructions the co-pilot actioned the upset recovery items when instructed to do so by the commander. These included extending the flaps to Flap 15.

The commander recovered the aircraft to controlled flight at FL130, having descended through about 1,000 ft. During the recovery, pitch increased from nose-down to a nose-up attitude of 19°, before reducing to a normal value. During the pitch and roll oscillations, the IAS varied between 190 kt and 123 kt.

During the manoeuvres the co-pilot transmitted a MAYDAY call and, once control had been regained and the situation assessed, the decision was made to return to Guernsey. The aircraft subsequently landed at Guernsey without further incident and no injuries were reported.
The aircraft was withdrawn from service pending a maintenance check. Functional tests were conducted on the aircraft’s ice detection, anti-ice and de-ice systems as well as the Aircraft Performance Monitoring (APM) system. No abnormalities were found, but analysis of the FDR data indicated that, during the recovery manoeuvre, the extended flaps sustained an overspeed of 5 kt. The aircraft was subsequently returned to service.

=AAIB Conclusion=
The aircraft suffered an in-flight upset at FL130 after accruing airframe icing during the climb, resulting in the adverse aerodynamic effect of ice build-up on the wings. The crew were presented with a degraded perf caution but did not action the relevant checklist because they focused on climbing out of the icing conditions. The IAS was not maintained at or above red bug +10 kt and control of the aircraft was lost when a turn was initiated in the l/nav mode of the flight director

The aircraft was rolled slightly right by the crew to counter the crosswind. As the ground speed slowed through 100 kt, the crew felt the aircraft veer to the right. The aircraft was returned to the centre-line by the captain applying rudder
input. As the aircraft reached about 80 kt the captain handed over the control yoke to the first officer while maintaining directional control with the nose wheel steering tiller. Shortly after, the aircraft turned right again and departed the runway. The captain regained directional control as the aircraft approached 20 kt (37 km/h).
One passenger reported receiving a minor injury during the occurrence. That injury was consistent with a ‘whiplash’ from lateral acceleration.
Subsequent examination found no aircraft damage. Runway tyre marks associated with the landing showed that at least one of the right main landing gear wheels had departed from the runway.

Contributing factors:
Consistent with pilot-induced oscillations, the captain's rudder and nose wheel steering inputs overcorrected heading deviations during the landing roll.

16 Oct 2013,ATR 72-600 (72-212A),RDPL-34233,Lao Airlines,49,8 km NW of Pakse Airport (PKZ),w/o,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/320662,ATR 72-600,AT76,15:55,1071,P&W Canada PW127M,Fatalities: 49 / Occupants: 49,0,Accident,Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Vientiane-Wattay Airport (VTE/VLVT),Pakse Airport (PKZ/VLPS),"Lao Airlines flight 301, an ATR 72-600, crashed into the sea while on approach to Pakse Airport, Laos, killing all 49 occupants.

Flight QV301 originated in Vientiane, Laos at 14:45 and operated a domestic service to Pakse. Weather in the area was poor as a result of a passing typhoon.
The flight was cleared for a VOR-DME non-precision approach to runway 15. After passing the final approach fix, the procedure called for a descent to the minimum descent altitude of 990 feet. After this the approach may only be continued if ground visual references are available.
The crew however incorrectly set the altitude preselect (ALT SEL) mode to 600 feet. This was still below the (incorrectly) published height of 645 feet on their Jeppesen chart.
Since the ground was not visible at 600 feet, the crew disconnected the autopilot and aborted the approach with the intention to conduct a missed approach.
After the aborted approach, the Flight Director vertical mode switched to Go Around and immediately went into altitude capture mode because the altitude selected was 600 feet. The missed approach was followed by a right turn instead of a nominal climb as published in the VOR-DME approach chart. The airplane began losing altitude.
A series of EGPWS warnings sounded and the height reached the minimum value of 60 feet above ground level and the roll reached approximately 37Â° to the right.
When the flight crew realized that the altitude was too close to the ground, the captain over-reacted, which led to a high pitch attitude of 33Â°. The Flight Director command bars then disappeared from the screen because of the extreme aircraft position.
The airplane climbed to an altitude of 1750 feet until the airplane pitched down again. The Flight Director command bars then reappeared and centered during the descent, because the selected altitude was still 600 feet.
The descent was continued until the airplane impacted the Mekong River. The fuselage broke and sank in the river.

Causes of the Accident:
The probable cause of this accident were the sudden change of weather condition and the flight crew's failure to properly execute the published instrument approach, including the published missed approach procedure, which resulted in the aircraft impacting the terrain.
The following factors may have contributed to the accident:
- The flight crew's decision to continue the approach below the published minima
- The flight crew's selection of an altitude in the ALT SEL window below the minima, which led to misleading FD horizontal bar readings during the go-around
- Possible Somatogravic illusions suffered by the PF
- The automatic reappearance of the FD crossbars consistent with the operating logic of the aeroplane systems, but inappropriate for the go-around
- The inadequate monitoring of primary flight parameters during the go-around, which may have been worsened by the PM's attention all tunneling on the management of the aircraft flap configuration
- The flight crew's limited coordination that led to a mismatch of action plans between the PF and the PM during the final approach.

20 Feb 2014,ATR 72-600 (72-212A),VH-FVR,Virgin Australia Regional,0,"47 km WSW of Sydney, NSW",sub,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/320567,ATR 72-600,AT76,16:41,1058,Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127M,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 52,0,Accident,En route,Passenger - Scheduled,"Canberra Airport, ACT (CBR/YSCB)","Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD/YSSY)","A Virgin Australia Regional ATR 72-600 sustained damage in an in-flight pitch disconnect event near Sydney, Australia.

= Feb 20 accident =
Flight VA657 departed Canberra, Australia at 16:12 local time with the first officer as the pilot flying. A steeper-than-usual climb was carried out to reduce exposure to turbulence. However, other than the expected turbulence during the first 1,500 ft, there was nothing significant during the climb to FL170.
During cruise, the crew conducted a routine brief for the anticipated arrival to runway 16R, which was expected to be standard except for commencement of descent 5 NM (9 km) earlier than normal to compensate for a tailwind. The captain noted the need to be cognizant of managing airspeed during the descent as the anticipated decreasing tailwind would result in a temporary increase in the indicated airspeed.
The first officer commenced descent into Sydney with the autopilot engaged in vertical speed mode and a target airspeed of 235 kt (15 kt less than the maximum operating speed of 250 kt). The descent was reported to have been initially stable and smooth.
On first contact with Sydney Approach the crew were assigned runway 16L. This was different to the expected runway and required the crew to re-brief the approach and change the instrument approach diagrams and navigational aid frequencies.
Passing 8,500 ft above mean sea level (AMSL), the crew noticed a rapid airspeed increase. The first officer reported that the airspeed trend indicator was 'off the chart', indicating a very rapid increase in airspeed. The first officer reduced engine power and used touch control steering to temporarily disconnect the autopilot before manually raising the aircraft's nose to control the speed. The first officer expected that, in combination, the pitch correction and power reduction would be sufficient to arrest the speed trend.
The first officer reported that the aircraft felt 'heavy', as was normal for this aircraft at that speed, requiring two hands on the controls to move from the then -4Â° pitch angle.
The captain reported being unsure if the first officer's control inputs would be sufficient to avoid exceeding the maximum operating speed limitation, so put one of his hands on the controls and disconnected the autopilot to raise the nose further.
Shortly after, with both flight crew making simultaneous nose up pitch inputs on the controls, the aircraft rapidly pitched up with an associated increase in the g load. The first officer responded by immediately reversing the control input to nose down. Both flight crew noticed that the controls suddenly felt different and 'spongy'. At about the same time, aural and visual cockpit warnings activated. The crew verified that the aircraft was under control at a stable attitude and speed, observing that it was level or in a slight descent at an airspeed of about 230 kt.
One of the cockpit warnings was 'pitch disconnect', indicating that the left and right elevator control systems had uncoupled from each other. This allowed for independent movement of the left and right elevators via the captain's and first officer's control columns respectively.
The crew consulted the pitch disconnect checklist and worked to identify which control column was free and working normally. After determining that both controls were free, it was decided that the captain would be pilot flying for the remainder of the approach and landing at Sydney Airport. The aerodynamic loads generated during the pitch disconnect resulted in serious injury to the senior cabin crew member and significant damage to the aircraft's horizontal stabiliser.

= Inspection =
Two maintenance engineers were tasked to inspect the aircraft after landing. A readout of the aircraft systems computer revealed a maximum vertical load factor of 3.34 g at 16:41 hours. This load factor was abnormally high and prompted one of the engineers to discuss it with the crew, who were surprised about the high value. The crew added Â‘associated with moderate turbulenceÂ’ to the maintenance log entry. Since this g-value was outside of the acceptable limits for the aircraft weight, the engineer he grounded the aircraft.
The applicable maintenance was determined to be the 'Inspection after flight in turbulence and/or exceeding VMO'.
That evening a visual inspection was conducted of the wing, using an elevated platform. The engineer also used a torch to inspect the rear fuselage and tail. However, no high-access platform was available, so no close visual inspection was performed on the horizontal stabilizer.
Other maintenance was carried out the next morning, which consisted of among others an operational test of the pitch uncoupling mechanism re-engagement system. The aircraft was then released for service on 13:30 the day after the accident.
Subsequent to the post-occurrence maintenance completed on 21 February 2014, the aircraft was operated on a further 13 flights. The respective flight crews did not record any anomalies or defects during their pre-flight inspections and there were no reports of any abnormal aircraft handling characteristics.

= Feb 25 incident =
On 25 February, aircraft VH-FVR was operated on a scheduled passenger flight from Sydney to Albury, NSW. On descent into Albury, the aircraft passed in close proximity to birds, which alerted the captain to the possibility of a birdstrike on the left side of the aircraft. There were no in-flight indications that a bird had struck the aircraft but after landing, the captain noticed the aircraftÂ’s pitch trim system fluctuated abnormally.
The captain conducted a walk-around inspection and, although there was no evidence of a birdstrike on the left of the aircraft, he identified a dent in the top leading edge of the vertical stabiliser. The captain advised the operatorÂ’s maintenance watch who dispatched an engineer to Albury to inspect the aircraft.
The engineer used scissor lift equipment to gain access to, and inspect the stabiliser. He did not find any evidence of a birdstrike, such as blood or feathers. However, the engineer did find indications of significant structural damage to the horizontal stabiliser, and contacted maintenance watch to cancel the following flights. Upon further examination and discussion with the airline, it became evident that the damage found at Albury was probably a consequence of the occurrence on 20 February.

Findings:
From the evidence available, the following findings are made regarding the in-flight upset and inadvertent pitch disconnect involving ATR 72 aircraft, VH-FVR on 20 February 2014 resulting in cabin crew injury and serious aircraft damage. A post-event maintenance inspection was carried out but the aircraft damage was not detected. Consequently, the aircraft was operated for another 13 flights over 5 days before the damage was identified.

Contributing factors:
- During the descent, when the sterile flight deck policy was applicable, the flight crew engaged in non-pertinent conversation. This distracted the crew and probably reduced their ability to monitor and respond to fluctuations of airspeed.
- While passing through about 8,500 ft on descent into Sydney, the aircraft encountered a significant windshear that resulted in a rapidly decreasing tailwind. This led to a rapid increase in the airspeed, with the airspeed trend vector likely indicating well above the maximum operating speed (VMO).
- Although the first officer (pilot flying) was in the process of attempting to control the airspeed, in response to the unexpectedly high airspeed trend indication, and their proximity to VMO, the captain (pilot not flying) perceived a need to immediately intervene, and made pitch control inputs before following the normal take-over procedure and alerting the first officer.
- The addition of the captainÂ’s and first officerÂ’s nose-up control inputs resulted in a pitching manoeuvre that exceeded the limit load factor for the aircraft of 2.5 g.
- The magnitude of the captain's nose-up control input was probably greater than he intended, due to his response to a high stress level, but increased the probability that the aircraft's limit load factor would be exceeded.
- Shortly after the captain initiated the nose-up control inputs, the first officer reversed his control input. The differential forces in the left (captain) and right (first officer) pitch control systems were sufficiently large to inadvertently activate the pitch uncoupling mechanism, disconnecting the left and right pitch control systems.
- Given the high airspeed, the asymmetric elevator deflections that occurred immediately following the pitch disconnect event resulted in aerodynamic loads on the tailplane that exceeded its strength and damaged the horizontal stabiliser.
- The design of the ATR 72 pitch control system resulted in limited tactile feedback between the left and right control columns, reducing the ability of one pilot to detect that the other pilot is making control inputs. In addition, there were no visual or auditory systems to indicate dual control inputs. (Safety issue)

The aircraft speed was 246 kt, close to the maximum operating speed (VMO) of 250 kt. The crew then felt strong vibrations followed by an alarm associated with the electronic controller (PEC) which controls the right propeller.
After the flight, the drive shaft of the engine's AC generator right was found broken and was replaced. A maintenance team carried out maintenance tests on both engine/propeller assemblies. No vibration or operation abnormal was detected.
The next day's flight was normal. During the taxi on landing, the crew reported a loud vibration noise as they move the power levers from the idle position to ground idle.
Following this flight, various maintenance operations were undertaken. Three tests on the ground of the engine/propeller assembly ware carried out and did not highlight any abnormal operation. An element of the propeller control system (the propeller valve module) was replaced. A fourth ground test was performed, during which the power levers were positioned in reverse thrust.
Vibrations appeared and the engines were immediately shut down. After the stop of the engines, blades nÂ°1, 2, 5 and 6 of the right propeller were feathered while blades nÂ°3 and 4 seemed to have remained in the reverse thrust position. Removal of the right propeller blades revealed, among other things, the failure of the blade pin No. 4 and damage to the propeller blade angle change cylinder plate.

Other incidents
The circumstances and damage observed were similar to those observed in an investigation of a serious incident on 18 September 2013 in Indonesia involving an ATR 72-500 registered PK-WFV. The Indonesian investigating authority, NTSC, had initiated an investigation and issued an immediate safety recommendation to the aircraft operator regarding the verification of the condition of the propeller blade pins and the search for indications of cracks in part of the fleet.

On November 30, 2014, a new similar incident occurred in Sweden involving an ATR 72-500 registered SE-MDB for which the Swedish investigating authority, SHK, had opened an investigation. Shortly after this incident, the BEA issued four safety recommendations to EASA.

Causes of the incident
Seven vibration phenomena on ATR 72-212A have been reported in recent years. In almost all cases, the failure of the pin of one of the blades and damage to the front plate of the propeller blade angle change cylinder were found. The investigation revealed the existence of alternating overloads causing damage to the plates and a final overload in a direction resulting in the failure of the crank pin.
The origin of these overloads and the precise timing of the damage and vibration could not be determined. Nevertheless, several elements may have contributed to this:
- a retention force caused by friction in the area of the blade foot bearings (ball bunching);
- significant forces caused by the impact of the crank pin on the platform ear during cyclic force phenomena on the front platform that occur when the aircraft speed is close to the VMO and the power levers in the idle position flight;
- unexpected operation of the servo loop of the propeller control system disrupted by cyclic forces on the front plate and friction phenomena.
The maintenance work carried out on the 9Y-TTC following the vibration phenomena did not identify this damage.

On 11 June 2014, between 0100 to 0500 LT, runway maintenance was performed by a group of 10 workers, using tools including pneumatic compressor, jack hammer, chisel, high air pressure hose, asphalt mixer, small container for asphalt mixture, debris sweeper and other supporting equipment.
At 04:05 LT, the Airport Facility Readiness personnel conducted a runway readiness check in conjunction with patrolling the airside using a patrol car. At 04:30 LT, they reported to the Juanda Tower controller that the runway was clear from any hazard except the area near intersection N3 where the runway repair was still in progress. At 04:50 LT, the airport maintenance team reported to Juanda Tower controller that the runway repair had finished and the runway maintenance team had left the runway. No runway inspection was performed after the runway repair finished.
The airport opened for traffic at 05:00 as planned. Until 06:06 hours, a total of eleven aircraft departed and one aircraft arrived. No pilot reported any foreign objects on the runway. The first pilot report of objects was near the intersection taxiway N5 and was made at 06:09 LT which was after sunrise at 05:59 LT. At 06:15 LT, the controller contacted the Airport Facility Readiness personnel but received no reply. Thereafter the controller contacted the ARFF personnel and informed them of the pilot report of an object on the runway and requested a check. When the ARFF vehicle arrived near the runway the controller instructed to wait for three aircraft that were about to land.
At 06:20 LT, an ATR 72-600 (PK-WGK) with flight number IW1861 landed and impacted the chisel, which resulted in eight holes in the aircraft lower fuselage.
The controller then decided to close the runway operation and instructed the ARFF personnel to enter and inspect the runway. The ARFF personnel found a compressor hose (about 10 meters long), a jack hammer (about 60 cm long) and chisel (about 4.5 kg) on the runway.

Contributing Factors:
- The runway inspection that was performed while the runway maintenance has not been finished resulted in the object which were on dark color and found on dark surface did not properly inspect.
- The insufficient information regarding the objects and the location might have made improper assessment to the consequences of the runway operation and delaying the object removal.

On the day before the incident a scheduled fuel nozzle replacement was carried out on engine no. 1 during night halt at Delhi. After replacement of fuel nozzle, wet motoring was carried out and no leak was observed. Idle power engine ground run was carried out and slight wetting at the #6 fuel nozzle was observed, #6 fuel nozzle was torqued, again a ground run was carried out and no leak was observed. The task was completed at 23:50 UTC. Subsequently aircraft was released for flight, which was scheduled at 00:50 hrs UTC.
The weather at the time of departure from Delhi was fine with visibility 5000 m. The aircraft was cleared for takeoff from runway 29 by ATC at around 00:50 UTC. During initial takeoff roll all parameters were normal. First officer was the Pilot Flying and commander was the Pilot Monitoring. Soon after initial takeoff roll, the engine no. 1 fire warning illuminated (before V1) with the engine no.1 fire alarm getting activated. The commander immediately took controls from first officer and takeoff was rejected. All the actions as per ""on ground engine fire or severe mechanical damage"" checklist were carried out and a MAY DAY call was made.
Fire extinguishing agent was discharged in the no. 1 as per the checklist. The fire warning was extinguished after the second extinguisher was discharged. Subsequently the aircraft was towed back to the bay and passengers were disembarked safely. There were no injuries.

Probable cause of the Incident:
The fire warning during takeoff roll was because of fire to the fuel which leaked from fuel nozzles due to loose B-nuts of fuel nozzles.

The aircraft departed from Ngurah Rai Airport at 17:10. The Second in Command (SIC) who was under line training acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM) and the third pilot who occupied the cockpit observer seat was also a pilot under line training.
During the approach to Lombok, while the aircraft descended below 500 ft, the PIC took over control while giving several instructions to the SIC to follow on the controls and landing the aircraft. After correcting the flight path, the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) indicated that the SIC was controlling the aircraft, however, the CVR did not record communication between the pilot related to transfer of control form the PIC to the SIC.
At 17:52, the aircraft touched down and bounced three times with left wing up and rolled to the right about 2°. The aircraft travelled out of the runway for about 180 meters and stopped at approximate 15 meters on the right side of the runway 13.
After the aircraft stop, the pilot issued a Mayday-call to the Lombok Tower controller and requested for assistance. The pilot then shut off the engines by activation the engine fire handle. The flight attendant contacted the pilot and asked for passenger evacuation, the PIC instructed to evacuate the passenger via left door.

The investigation concluded that the contributing factors to this serious incidents are:
1. Two transfer of control at critical altitude without clear statement might have made that pilots not aware who has the full control of the flight and jeopardize the flight when the pilot receive the control not fully aware to the condition of the flight.
2. The handling of the aircraft after bounce was contrary to the wind condition, and the application of the right rudder and cross wind condition might have made the aircraft turned to the right.

4 Feb 2015,ATR 72-600 (72-212A),B-22816,TransAsia Airways,43,"5,3 km E of Taipei-Songshan Airport (TSA)",w/o,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/320360,ATR 72-600,AT76,10:54,1141,P&W Canada PW127M,Fatalities: 43 / Occupants: 58,0,Accident,Initial climb,Passenger - Scheduled,Taipei-Songshan Airport (TSA/RCSS),Kinmen-Shang-Yi Airport (KNH/RCBS),"TransAsia Airways flight GE235, an ATR 72-600, crashed into the Keelung River shortly after takeoff from Taipei-Songshan Airport, Taiwan, killing 43 occupants; 15 survived the accident.

A TransAsia ATR-72-600 operating as flight GE235 from Taipei to Kinmen Island impacted a highway viaduct and the waters of the Keelung River near New Taipei City shortly after takeoff. Forty-three occupants on board the airplane suffered fatal injuries. Fifteen were injured.
The airplane took off from Taipei-Sung Shan Airport's runway 10 at 10:51 hours local time and turned right, climbing to an altitude of 1350 feet. At 10:52 the master warning sounded in the cockpit associated with the right engine (no. 2) flame out procedure message. Some 26 seconds later the left hand (no. 1) power lever was retarded to flight idle. After twenty seconds the left engine condition lever was set to the fuel shutoff position resulting in left engine shutdown.
Instead of continuing the climbing right hand turn, the airplane had turned left and began losing altitude and speed with several stall warnings sounding in the cockpit. At 10:53, the flight contacted the Sung Shan Tower controller declaring a Mayday and reporting an 'engine flameout'. The airplane then turned to the right while the crew attempted to restart the left hand engine.
This succeeded at 10:54:20 hours. Fourteen seconds later the stall warning sounded in the cockpit. Video footage of the accident show that the airplane banked almost 90 degrees left as it hit a taxi on a viaduct. Parts of the left hand wing broke off upon hitting the barrier of the viaduct. The airplane broke up as it impacted the Keelung River and came to rest inverted.

Findings Related to Probable Causes:
Powerplant
1. An intermittent signal discontinuity between the auto feather unit (AFU) number 2 and the torque sensor may have caused the automatic take off power control system (ATPCS):
- Not being armed steadily during takeoff roll;
- Being activated during initial climb which resulted in a complete ATPCS sequence including the engine number 2 autofeathering.
2. The available evidence indicated the intermittent discontinuity between torque sensor and auto feather unit (AFU) number 2 was probably caused by the compromised soldering joints inside the AFU number 2.

Flight Operations
3. The flight crew did not reject the take off when the automatic take off power control system ARM pushbutton did not light during the initial stages of the take off roll.
4. TransAsia did not have a clear documented company policy with associated instructions, procedures, and notices to crew for ATR72-600 operations communicating the requirement to reject the take off if the automatic take off power control system did not arm.
5. Following the uncommanded autofeather of engine number 2, the flight crew failed to perform the documented failure identification procedure before executing any actions. That resulted in pilot flying's confusion regarding the identification and nature of the actual propulsion system malfunction and he reduced power on the operative engine number 1.
6. The flight crew's non-compliance with TransAsia Airways ATR72-600 standard operating procedures - Abnormal and Emergency Procedures for an engine flame out at take off resulted in the pilot flying reducing power on and then shutting down the wrong engine.
7. The loss of engine power during the initial climb and inappropriate flight control inputs by the pilot flying generated a series of stall warnings, including activation of the stick pusher. The crew did not respond to the stall warnings in a timely and effective manner.
8. The loss of power from both engines was not detected and corrected by the crew in time to restart an engine. The aircraft stalled during the attempted restart at an altitude from which the aircraft could not recover from loss of control.
9. Flight crew coordination, communication, and threat and error management (TEM) were less than effective, and compromised the safety of the flight. Both operating crew members failed to obtain relevant data from each other regarding the status of both engines at different points in the occurrence sequence. The pilot flying did not appropriately respond to or integrate input from the pilot monitoring.

It was towed onto Stand 131S prior to the flight. The Load Instruction Report (LIR) indicated that 421 kgs (32 pieces) of baggage were loaded in the forward hold; the computer generated loadsheet, which was presented to the commander, recorded this loading. The flight pushed back from the stand on schedule. The aircraft took off outside the certified Centre of Gravity (CG) limits.
The commander, who was Pilot Flying (PF) on that sector, stated that the aircraft felt tail heavy on take-off. Following departure, the flight crew checked the loadsheet and LIR both of which indicated that the aircraft had been loaded correctly, with all passenger baggage in the forward hold. In his report on the event, the commander stated that during descent into Rennes, he briefed the co-pilot that the landing would be somewhat flat due to the ‘tailheavy’ condition. The aircraft landed at its destination without further incident where it was subsequently discovered that all the baggage had actually been loaded in the aft hold.

Probable Cause:
Passenger baggage was loaded into an incorrect hold.
Contributing Factors:
1. The passenger baggage was not loaded in accordance with the Load Instruction Report (LIR).
2. The correct procedure for the completion of the LIR was not followed.
3. The loading was completed under time pressure.

Hasan Aroeboesman Airport (ENE/WATE),"The ATR 72-600 aircraft, registered PK-GAF bounced on landing at Ende-H. Hasan Aroeboesman Airport (WATE).

The ATR 72-600 departed from Kupang at 04:45 UTC. The flight until the approach to Ende was uneventful. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as pilot flying (PF) while Second in Command (SIC) acted as pilot monitoring (PM).
At 05:37 UTC, the SIC advised the Ende Aeronautic Communication Officer (ACO) that the aircraft was turning on final runway 27. The ACO responded that the wind direction was 150Â° with velocity of 18 knots and advised that the runway was clear. According to the pilots observation, the weather was clear without scattered cumulus. On short final, the SIC checked the wind sock located on the right side of the runway and noticed that wind was as expected.
The aircraft touched down nosewheel first in the touchdown zone with and bounced to the left of the runway centerline. The aircraft then experienced the second touchdown on the left shoulder of the runway. During the second bounce, the master warning light illuminated consisted with the â€œPitch Disconnectâ€ warning on the Engine and Warning Display (EWD). The flight crew applied significant dual and opposite control columns inputs
(leading to pitch uncoupling mechanism activation) - pitch down by the PIC on left seat and pitch up by the SIC on right seat (pitch up authority is higher).
After the second bounce, the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) recorded an increasing value of TQs. The pilot performed a go around and turned right to avoid obstacles at the end of runway 27. Both pilots assessed the situation and decided to divert to Labuan Bajo. The flight continued uneventfully and landed safely at Labuan Bajo.

The investigation concluded the contributing factors of the occurrence as follows:
- Continuation of unstabilized approach with too much speed and nose down attitude resulted in the nose wheel touched the runway first, and with the roll about 3Â° to the left made the aircraft bounce to the left of runway centerline.
- The absence of immediate go around initiation after the first bounce resulted in the aircraft made second touched down on the left shoulder of the runway.

The aircraft departed Delhi Airport as flight 9W2793 at 17:40 local time (12:10 UTC).
While en route ATIS was obtained by the crew approximately at 115 NM from Indore and the arrival briefing was completed at 100 NM from Indore. The crew asked ATC for permission to descend at 19:10, much before their descent point, so as to keep clear of weather and avoid turbulence. The winds reported by ATC were 130Â° and 08 knots. As the winds were favourable for runway 07 the crew decided for a VOR approach to runway 07 via DME arc.
At 19:23 crew reported commencing the arc. While on final approach the crew asked for winds, ATC informed crew that the winds were 320Â° and 12 knots. The crew also saw tail winds on their Primary Flight Display (PFD) and decided to discontinue the approach. ATC then cleared the aircraft for an ILS approach to runway 25 from overhead. The crew then requested an ILS approach to runway 25 via the DME arc, as there was weather overhead. This was accepted by ATC at 19:31. At the same time ATC also informed crew that winds were then 100Â° and 12 knots. The aircraft climbed 4000 feet and was kept left of the runway, keeping runway in visual contact.
The crew continued with the approach and went out for 15 NM to avoid weather before turning right to intercept the ILS. The flight reported established on localizer at 19:37 and was informed by ATC of moderate rain on airfield. At 19:38 crew reported intercepting ILS and was cleared to land with reported winds of 13 knots at 160Â°. As per the statement of crew the approach was clear and runway lights could be seen from 13 NM. The runway lights and PAPI lights appeared bright and hence the crew requested ATC to reduce the intensity of the lights.
As the aircraft descended through 600 feet, auto pilot was disconnected. After the aircraft touched down, it veered to the right. The PIC tried to control the aircraft using rudder to turn it to the left. However aircraft went excessively to the left. The PIC was also warned by the co-pilot about the aircraft heading. The aircraft continued going left even after application of full right rudder by the PIC.
The aircraft subsequently went out of the runway into the unpaved surface on left, damaging runway edge lights, runway marking light and a taxiway edge light. The aircraft travelled approximately 180 meters on the unpaved surface while jumping a pit and crossing taxiway F near the isolation bay before coming to halt 78 meters away from runway centre line, with heading 204Â°.

Probable cause of the Accident:
Improper cross wind landing technique and failure to use nose wheel steering or differential braking after rudder efficiency was diminished due to decreasing speed caused the aircraft to veer out of runway.
The runway condition was a contributory factor.

The right-hand wingtip of the Embraer 190 was broken and the wing of the ATR 72 was also damaged. No one was
injured.

Primary Cause (from final report):
During taxiing into the apron, the pilot was carelessly maneuvering the aircraft and trying to make 180 turn too close to another aircraft on his own judgment in a rush-rush manner without proper help of the ground handling service .
Contributing Factors
a) The copilot of the incident aircraft was not able to make right judgment on taxiing into the apron whether his aircraft was clear of obstacle or not.
b) The wingman and marshaller were not able to identify so early whether their aircraft was clear of obstacle or not.
c) The pilot had no fully faith and trust on their own ground handling service personnel in terms of ground handling service.

After starting the engines at 20:54, the crew taxied to the taxiway and received clearance for take-off at 21:00 on runway Runway 32.
During the first take-off attempt, speed indication problems appeared. The take-off phase continued until an uncommanded lift-off. The captan then decided to abort the take-off (RTO). He taxied back to runway Runway 32 for a second take-off.
At 21:08 UTC, the captain carried out a second take-off. This second take-off attempt was deliberately aborted because of a speed indication problem (IAS DISAGREE) characterised by a difference in speed indication between the captain's side and the first officer's side. The aircraft proceeded up runway 32 and then up the ramp. At about 21:12, while taxiing, and just after the left turn to the overrun ramp, the air traffic controller advised the aircraft crew of the presence of a fire on the right engine and immediately alerted the Airport Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting Service (ARFFS). The crew followed the right-engine fire procedure and then evacuated the aircraft.
An ARFF intervention brought the landing gear fire under control.
The aircraft had just come out of the technical check (Check A) carried out in an approved maintenance workshop at Benslimane Airport (GMMB).


Direct Causes
- Obstruction of the Pitot probes which caused an underestimation of the take-off speed ;
- Take-off speed deviation not identified during the first attempt, due to non-application of operational procedures ;
- Excessive braking actions and durations following the two consecutive RTOs aggravated by high-speed ""Flight Idle"" taxiing.
2. Contributing factors
- Absence of ATR manufacturer's procedures relating to brake cooling following an RTO ;
- Time pressure related to airport closure ;
- CRM failure ;
- Human factors aspects such as stress and the strong captain ascent gradient in relation to the co-pilot's reactions ;
- Risks related to the nature of the Benslimane airport environment which could obstruct the tubes of the pitot probes when they are not protected (Presence of impurities/insects).

It was the last of five flights of the day for the commander and the first officer. During the first four flights, the first officer felt normal. The first officer had no abdominal pain and did not experience any stomach or digestive problems. Between the fourth flight of the day and the flight of the serious incident, the first officer experienced some abdominal pain. After a visit to the toilet, the pain subsided, and the first officer felt all right. Shortly after take-off, when the pressurisation process of the aircraft started, the first officer felt the pain reappearing. The first officer – who was the pilot flying - turned the aircraft slightly north of track in order to avoid an area with possible adverse weather conditions. When the aircraft was east of the island of Samsoe, approximately halfway between EKCH and EKBI, the aircraft was clear of the area with adverse weather. At that time the first officer felt that he was becoming increasingly incapacitated and handed over the control of the aircraft to the commander. Following the handover, the first officer became very weak, and he was mentally and physically unable to perform any further flight duties. The first officer was in cold sweat, and the abdominal pain became quite severe. In order to prevent the first officer from interfering with the controls of the aircraft, the commander locked the shoulder harness of the first officer and secured the first officer seat in the rearmost position. The cabin crew was called to the cockpit, and they assisted the first officer The commander informed Air Traffic Control (ATC) of the situation and requested medical assistance upon arrival at EKBI. Page 5 of 9 The remaining part of the flight and the landing at EKBI was uneventful, and was completed by the commander as a single flight crew operation. Arriving at the gate, the first officer got medical assistance. The serious incident occurred during twilight and in visual meteorological conditions (VMC).

The flight was uneventful until just before the aircraft began its descent into Cork, at which point the Flight Crew received a Master Caution, triggered by two electrical faults. This was followed by a Master Warning associated with electrical smoke and by the sight and smell of smoke in the cockpit. The Flight Crew donned their oxygen masks, declared an emergency (Mayday) to Air Traffic Control (ATC), and carried out the SMOKE Checklist memory actions. Non-normal checklists associated with Smoke, Electrical Smoke, and associated electrical failures were also completed, including the Manual Gear Extension checklist. The smoke cleared and the aircraft landed normally.
There were no injuries.
Examination of the number 2 static inverter showed that a C602 capacitor within the unit had failed in a manner that resulted in electrical smoke being emitted from the unit. This smoke entered the avionics ventilation air flow and was detected by the avionics smoke detector installed in the avionics extract air duct, triggering the associated Master Warnings. The smoke also entered the cockpit and forward cabin, where it was noticed by the Flight Crew and No. 2 CCM.

Probable Cause: ""Failure of the C602 (1-001-0306-0136) capacitor within the number two static inverter.""

During the intermediate descent prior to commencing the published instrument approach procedure for runway 28, the aircraft descended below the altitude assigned by the Air Traffic Control Officer (ATCO).
Theâ€˜Minimum Safe Altitude Warningâ€™ (MSAW) activated on the ATCOâ€™s radar screen to warn the ATCO about the aircraftâ€™s continued descent.
The aircraft had descended to an altitude of 1,082 ft. The altitude of an aircraft at this point on the ILS glideslope for RWY 28 should have been 1,975 ft.
When contacted by the ATCO, the Commander initiated a missed approach, climbed to a safe altitude and obtained radar vectors for a second approach. The aircraft subsequently landed at EIDW without further incident.

Probable Cause:
While conducting an ILS approach, the aircraft was descended unintentionally to an altitude that triggered the ATC Minimum Safe Altitude Warning.
Contributory Cause(s)
1.The Flight Crewâ€™s lack of experience on the ATR72 â€˜-600â€™ aircraft.
2.The Commander became distracted by the manual operation of the TLU to the extent that the flight path was not adequately monitored.
3.There were inappropriate pitch inputs made to the Commanderâ€™s control column that caused the autopilot to disengage.
4.The level of cockpit communication and co-ordination between the Flight Crew was sub-optimal

During the final approach on ILS runway 21 in the pilots encountered heavy rain conditions and wind gusts plus ascending and descending wind currents.
The aircraft suffered a hard touchdown, bounced, touched down hard again with excessive load on the nose gear causing both nose wheels to separate while the nose gear strut remained intact.
The aircraft still had too much kinetic energy and bounced a second time, touching the third time on the runway and rolling
on with the main gear and over the nose gear structure.
The crew and passengers were disembarked normally without any injury reports between them.

Probable causes: PIC/PF decision to proceed and force the landing not complying with the unstabilized approach criteria, with air speed well above the reference VAPP.
Contributing factors: Fatigue may have contributed to the accident by directly affecting pilot (PIC/PF) performance.

En route to Ã…lesund, control of the aircraft was temporarily lost in severe icing conditions.
The control loss occurred in the airspace just west of FÃ¸rde Airport Bringeland as the crew had started to change course to escape the icing conditions.
The crew regained control of the aircraft and continued its flight to Ã…lesund where it subsequently landed as normal. No people on board were injured, nor was there any damage to the aircraft.

The AIBN is of the opinion that the loss of control was the result of a combination of insufficient planning and inappropriate decisions en route, particularly the crew's attempt to climb above the icing conditions despite degraded aircraft performance as well as incorrect use of the autopilot.
Control recovery may have been impeded by the commander's initial response, pulling the control wheel back as the stick shaker activated. The commander is likely to have become startled when the stick shaker activated and the autopilot automatically deactivated, while the aircraft at the same time suddenly banked sharply and simultaneously pitched nose down. He may consequently have pulled the control wheel back due to the so-called startle effect.
Another contribution to the non-optimal control recovery was that two memory items on the checklist for stalling, deploying flaps and increasing engine power, were omitted. However, the crew quickly regained their composure and the rest of the flight and landing in Ã…lesund proceeded without any further problems.
AIBN is of the opinion that icing should be a priority item in risk analyses for airlines when planning to operate in Norway during the icing season, and that it is important to take the characteristics of the aircraft type into account. Such analysis should conjointly consider the flown
routes, the flown flight levels, expected icing conditions, and mitigation actions to adverse conditions including icing, with regard to the aircraft type and specific performance.

The aircraft departed Bandung at 17:34 hours local time on a scheduled domestic fight to Semarang. The captain acted as Pilot Flying.
The flight from departure until commencing for landing approach was uneventful. The approach was conducted according to the RNAV approach procedure runway 13. At 18:20, the flight was on final and the runway was in sight. The tower controller advised that the surface wind direction was 190Â° with velocity of 15 knots, altimeter setting 1,008 mbs and the runway was wet.
At 18:21, the tower controller had visual contact with the aircraft and issued landing clearance, the pilot acknowledged the clearance and requested to reduce the approach light intensity. The tower controller reduced the light intensity and confirmed whether the intensity was appropriate, which the pilot affirmed.
At 18:24, the aircraft touched down and bounced twice. After the second bounce, the pilot attempted to go around. The aircraft however touched down a third time at an acceleration of 6 G. During the landing roll, the aircraft tilted to the right and deviated to the right of the runway centreline. While waiting ARFF assistance the pilot kept the engines running to keep the cabin lighting system on.
At 18:29 the tower controller advised the pilot to shut down the engines since the ARFF personnel had arrived near the aircraft to assist the evacuation. Passenger evacuation was completed at approximately 10 minutes after the aircraft had stopped. No one was injured. The aircraft was substantially damaged. The right main landing gear folded inward and the propellers tips of engine number 2 were broken at about 26 cm from the tip.

Contributing Factors:
- The visual illusion of aircraft higher than the real altitude resulted in late flare out which made the aircraft bounced.
- The unrecovered bounce resulted in abnormal landing attitude with vertical acceleration up to 6 g and collapsed the right main landing gear.

The aircraft was being operated by Virgin Australia as flight 646 on a scheduled passenger flight from Sydney to Canberra. On board the aircraft was the captain, first officer, a check captain, two cabin crew and 67 passengers.
The first officer was pilot flying, and the captain was pilot monitoring. The check captain was positioned in the observer seat on the flight deck and was conducting an annual line check of the captain along with a six month line check of the first officer over four flights on the day. The occurrence flight was the last of these flights.
At about 13:20 local time the flight crew were conducting a visual approach to runway 35 at Canberra. The calculated approach speed was 113 kt. At 13:20:52, nine seconds prior to touch down, the aircraft approached the runway at a height of about 107 ft, slightly above the desired approach path. The flight crew reported that at about this time, there was turbulence and changing wind conditions. Flight data showed that at this time, speed had increased to 127 kt. In response to the increasing speed, the first officer reduced power to near flight idle.
Over the next five seconds, the descent rate increased significantly and the speed reduced.
During the last 50 ft of descent, the captain twice called for an increase in power and then called for a go-around. The first officer responded by increasing the power at about the same time as the aircraft touched down.
At 13:21:01, the aircraft touched down heavily on the main landing gear and rear fuselage with a peak recorded vertical acceleration of 2.97G. Assessing that the aircraft was under control, the captain immediately called to the first officer to cancel the go-around and then took control of the aircraft. The flight crew completed the landing roll and taxied to the gate without further incident.
After shutting down the engines, the flight crew reviewed the recorded landing data which indicated a hard landing had occurred, requiring maintenance inspections. The captain then made an entry in the aircraft technical log, and subsequent inspections revealed that the aircraft had been substantially damaged. There were no reported injuries.

Contributing factors:
- During the approach, the pilot flying did not identify that the speed had exceeded the stabilised approach criteria, which required immediate correction or initiation of a go-around.
- In response to an assessment of overshoot shear, the pilot flying reduced power to idle at a height greater than that stipulated by operator procedures. This resulted in an abnormally high descent rate that was not reduced prior to touchdown.
- A significant change in the wind direction and strength immediately before the aircraft touched down further increased the aircraft's descent rate and contributed to the resultant damage.
- Verbal and physical intervention by the pilot monitoring did not prevent the hard landing.

The Cessna was being operated by Balai Pendidikan dan Pelatihan Penerbangan Banyuwangi (BP3B) on a cross country training flight from Blimbingsari Airport (WADY), Banyuwangi to Sultan Muhammad Kaharuddin airport (WADS), Sumbawa Besar.
PK-BYK with two student pilots on board departed from WADY with intention to cruise at altitude of 7,000 feet and
when approaching point KUBU TAMBAHAN, PK-BYK requested to Bali approach controller to climb to altitude of 9,000 feet which was approved.
At the same time, the an ATR 72-600 had departed from WADS with cruising altitude of 8,000 feet. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as PM and the Second in Command (SIC) acted as PF.
When PK-BYK was approaching point NAMP ISLAND, the Cessna's PF saw an ATR 72-600 aircraft flying through clouds from the opposite direction with the aircraft nose slightly up. The PF of PK-BYK assumed that the ATR 72-600 aircraft was climbing, so he decided to descend with the intention to avoid the ATR 72-600 aircraft.

The separation of both aircraft reduced to below minima when the PK-BYK pilot left 9000 feet at 01:31:40 UTC, the distance of both aircraft was 4.7 nm and continued reducing to a horizontal distance of 2 nm.
Both flights continued their flight to the destination safely.

Contributing Factors
The assumption of ATR72-600 on climbing and not aware of the right of way rules resulted in the PK-BYK pilot decided to descend aircraft for traffic avoidance.

The Piper PA-28-181 (EC-JMT), was on a private VFR flight in the northwest of the island of Tenerife. The pilot informed the controller of his intention to descend from flight level FL115 for an approach to runway 12 at the Tenerife North Airport (GCXO). The controller authorized the maneuver and informed him that there was traffic, an ATR 72-600, which was reaching FL100, 10 miles northeast of its position.
The Binter Canarias ATR 72 aircraft (EC-MPI, flight NT631) had taken off from the Tenerife North Airport runway 12 using the SID ARACO3K. The flight was authorized to climb to flight level FL100 and, subsequently, to fly directly to 8.5 DME fix of runway 36 at the La Palma Airport.
Subsequently, the controller informed the Piper aircraft of the position of the ATR 72. At that time they were 5 miles apart. The controller also instructed him to maintain his flight level, between 105 or 110, until he had the ATR 72 in sight.
When the aircraft were 3 miles apart, the Piper pilot informed the controller that he had traffic in sight. The controller authorized him to continue the descent and proceed to the approach for runway 12.
The aircraft were in radio contact with the air traffic control service on different frequencies. The executive controller who was in contect with the ATR 72 was absent and his position was assumed by the planning controller. This last controller was unaware of the existence of the Piper traffic and was surprised that the ATR 72 informed him that he had had a TCAS warning.
Despite being visible, the distance between the aircraft was reduced to 1.13 miles, horizontally, and 200 feet vertically.
After the loss of separation, the aircraft continued their flights without further incident.

Causes/contributing factors:
The investigation has determined that this incident was caused because the GCCCINB sector controller did not inform the ATR 72-212A aircraft of the existence of another aircraft and its proximity.
They were contributing factors:
- Lack of compliance by controllers with the letter of agreement between units regarding transfers of control.
- A deficient relay of control post after the temporary absence of the sector controller GCCCINB.

The airport has a single 2,500 m asphalt runway.

PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT
The crew while attempting to land under high tailwind conditions, bounced twice and made a delayed touchdown which eventually resulted into runway overrun.
Contributory factor:
i. The runway selection by the crew, probably to save time, had tailwinds during approach and landing.
ii. The continuation of the approach while aircraft was not stabilised.
iii. The continuation of the landing while conditions were not suitable to stop the aircraft on the runway.

The flight was inadvertently landed at nearby Sintang-Susilo Airport which had been closed for operation.
Prior to departure, the pilot received the flight documents from the Flight Operation Officer (FOO) and no briefing related to the closing of Susilo Airport.
The information available on the aircraft library and website (aimindonesia) contained information of the old Susilo Airport which had been closed for operation since 26 April 2018. The information related to the new Tebelian Airport was available on the link of AIP Supplement on the website.
The pilot reviewed the Notice to Airman (NOTAM) related to Sintang Aerodrome and noted some changed airport data of such as elevation, threshold runway elevation and Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) identification and frequency. The pilot compared the changes of the Sintang Aerodrome information with the information contained on the Airport Visual Guidance (AVG) provided by the aircraft operator which published on 2 March 2018 and effective since 9 March 2018.

At 08:05 LT (01:05 UTC), in daylight conditions, the aircraft departed Supadio International Airport, Pontianak with flight number IW1370. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). The flight was the first flight on the day for the crew.
After takeoff, the aircraft flew direct to Sintang NDB identified as SG. The flight was conducted under Visual Flight Rules (VFR). There was no system abnormality reported or recorded from departure until commenced approach.
At 08:25, the pilot contacted Tebelian Flight Information Service Officer (FISO) with call sign Susilo Info on frequency 124.2 MHz. The pilot reported his position as 84 Nm from Sintang, climbing through 11,500 feet to the intended cruising altitude of 13,000 feet and estimated time arrival (ETA) would be at 08:51 LT. The pilot then requested weather information. The Tebelian FISO acknowledged the message and informed that the wind was calm, visibility 6 km, cloud scattered 1,400 feet, QNH4 1,012 hPa and QFE5 1,009 hPa.
At 0129 UTC, the pilot reported to Pontianak controller that they had established
communication with Sintang FISO. The Pontianak controller advised the pilot to
communicate with Sintang FISO and the radar service from Pontianak controller was
terminated.
At 08:44, the pilot reported position was 5 minutes out and on descend passing an altitude of 2,600 feet.
At 08:47, the pilot reported on finals and the runway was in sight. The Tebelian FISO informed that the runway was clear. Prior to land, the pilot could not recall that they saw the crossed bar mark on the runway threshold during final approach.
At 08:49, the aircraft touched down. Two minutes later, the pilot reported to Tebelian FISO that they had just landed. The Tebelian FISO noticed that the aircraft had was not landed at Tebelian Airport. The FISO confirmed to the pilot whether they landed at Susilo Airport which has been closed.
The aircraft continued taxi to the apron and the pilot informed the chief pilot to request further instruction.
The pilot communicated with Tebelian FISO and requested the detail of Tebelian Airport information including the coordinate then decided to continue the flight to Tebelian.
The Tebelian FISO communicated with Susilo Airport personnel who were responsible to secure the airport facilities. The Tebelian FISO requested the Susilo Airport personnel to check the runway condition. After the runway declared as clear, the Tebelian FISO informed to the pilot that the runway was clear and the security personnel were standing by on the airport perimeter.
At 09:34, the aircraft took off from Susilo Airport to Tebelian Airport and landed at 09:45. The passengers disembarked normally, no one injured and the aircraft was undamaged as the result of this occurrence.

Contributing Factors:
- Reassignment of the location indicator WIOS, NDB and AFIS VHF Frequency in conjunction with incomplete departure briefing, unaware to the content of AIP Supplement number 07/18, and out of date information in the file management system made the pilots unaware of the Susilo Airport had been closed for operation and the establishment of the new airport.
- The unfinished crossed white mark and the appearance of all normal runway markings made the pilot continued to land in the Susilo Airport.

The co-pilot was the pilot flying (PF); this was her first airline aircraft type and she was on training.
The crew conducted an approach to Fez runway 27 with a computed Vapp of 109 KIAS and the aircraft weight was 21.0 t.
The weather reported by Fez ATIS information R for that period on approach and landing was: surface wind 350Â° at 8 kt, visibility 10 km or more, air temperature 33Â°C and QNH 1019mbar.
The captain, as pilot monitoring (PM), reported that during the final flare, the aircraft was ""literally thrown to the deck"" and on the final moments, he grabbed the yoke, trying to reduce the rate of descent, but did not have sufficient time.
This resulted in a firm landing, during which the tail bumper contacted the ground and the belly scraped the runway.
The aircraft flight data and management system recorded a vertical acceleration at touchdown of +2,88G. The damage sustained was an abrasion of the tail bump and part of lower fuselage skin between frames FR35 and FR39.
The aircraft rolled out without further incident and taxied to the apron.
An external inspection and a walk around were performed by the captain, focused on the landing gear without any findings.
According to the operator data, the aircraft continued in-service, departing for the next scheduled flight, TP1427 from Fez, about one hour after landing, with 55 passengers on board to Lisbon.

Probable causes:
The investigation determined the accident most probable cause the flight crew performance on the landing maneuver, namely, with poor aircraft energy management while performing an unstable approach.

Contributing factors:
For the crew performance during the landing in Fez, the following direct contributing factors were identified:
- non-compliance by the PIC/LTC with the discontinued approach procedure,
- the PIC/LTC not performing the appropriate flight supervision techniques and the proper aircraft recovery from an unsafe condition on the unstable approach,
- the training process (LIFUS) with the consequent authorization for the trainee co-pilot to fly as PF, without a safety pilot on board, taking into account her known difficulties controlling the aircraft at landing,
- the missing explicit definition of the stabilized approach criteria by the operator.

For the crew decision process to start the return flight to Lisbon, the following contributing factors were identified:
- Organizational culture with inadequate or nonexistent procedures and individual-centered decision-making without effective implementation of the CRM philosophy,
- Lack of operatorÂ’s oversight by NAA to comply with certification regulations, not adopting SARPs in compliance checks.

9 Jul 2018,ATR 72-600 (72-212A),CN-COH,RAM Express,0,"2,6 km N off Al Hoceima-Charif Al Idrissi Airport (AHU)",sub,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/319614,ATR 72-600,AT76,20:05,1034,Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127M,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 58,0,Accident,Landing,Passenger - Scheduled,Tangier-Ibn Battouta Airport (TNG/GMTT),Al Hoceima-Charif Al Idrissi Airport (AHU/GMTA),"The RAM Express ATR 72-600, registration CN-COH, contacted the water during an approach to Al Hoceima Airport, Morocco. The flight crew performed a go around and diverted to Nador Airport.
The aircraft operated on a flight from Casablanca to Al Hoceima and Tangier (AT438) and return (AT439).
During the first leg, the ""TERRAIN"" warning message was displayed and the amber ""TERRAIN FAULT"" light illuminated, probably related to a degradation of the GPS signal in the area crossed by CN-COH while at FL160. It disappeared after about 6 minutes and 38 seconds. The crew flew the RNAV approach for Al Hoceima runway 17. Once at MDA (1,030 ft), the captain did not see the runway due to the low cloud ceiling and decided to continue the descent with a descent rate of about 1000 ft/min. One minute later, the ""TERRAIN AHEAD PULL UP"" and ""AVOID TERRAIN"" TAWS alarms were triggered when the aircraft was 1760m from the runway threshold and 60ft radio altitude. The Pilot Flying (PF) then performed a pitch-up attitude change and restored power. The lowest point reached was 45ft radio altitude. The aircraft then climbed to a height of 108 feet, which it maintained until the runway was in sight, and then resumed a descent to land.
The third leg of the flight was from Tangier Airport back to Al Hoceima Airport. Due to the short flight time, the approach briefing at Al Hoceima was carried out on the ground in Tangier, at the same time as the departure briefing. This time, the crew prepared a VOR/DME approach, the minima of which were 760 ft. The captain (Pilot Monitoring) explained to the first officer (Pilot Flying) that if the runway was not in sight at the minima, he would descend to 400 ft and maintain this altitude until the runway was in sight, and that if the runway was still not in sight at 2NM from the VOR, the approach would have to be aborted and a go-around would have to be made. In addition, the captain accepted, after consulting the Dispatch Deviation Manual (DDM), the co-pilot's suggestion to stop the GPWS to avoid alarms during the descent and approach, because they believed that the alarms emitted by this system, during the first leg, were untimely.
The plane took off from Tangier Airport at 18:30 and reached its cruising level of FL130 at 18:46. Descent was begun 6 minutes later. Before starting the descent, the captain discussed with the first officer the execution of the approach and gave him advice/instructions. At 18:55, the crew contacted the Al Hoceima tower air traffic controller. The controller asked the crew to confirm that they wished to conduct a VOR DME approach for runway 17, to which the crew replied in the affirmative. The controller then cleared them to descend to FL60 and asked them to call back on the VOR ALM. The LNAV mode was active. The crew engaged the AP (autopilot) V/S mode with a vertical speed of -1500 ft/min and selected the 6000 ft altitude. The captain instructed the first officer in the procedure with a point ""ALM01"", not on the published procedures, located at ""12.5 NM radial 336Â°"". At 18:56, the crew carried out a descent checklist, on the initiative of the PM (captain) and during this descent they increased the vertical speed to -1600 ft/min then to -1800 ft/min with an indicated speed of 230Kt. The captain reminded the first officer of the manoeuvres to be carried out in the event of a go-around and announced to the first officer that during the approach, he (the captain) would take care of monitoring ""speed and water"" and he (first officer) would take care of piloting.
Shortly before reaching 6000ft, at 18:58, the Indicated Speed of 210kt and an altitude of 3000ft were selected.
The crew selected the 3000-foot altitude and cross-checked the altimeters at QNH 1016 as they passed 6100 feet. Then the approach checklist was completed. At 18:59:54, the aircraft was 11.5 NM from the threshold of runway 17, speed 220Kt and altitude about 4500 feet, the captain deactivated the GPWS and reminded the first officer twice ""Gear and Flaps for a greater rate of descent"" he explained. At 19:00:16, at 4000 feet altitude, the heading increased from 90Â° to 148Â°, the captain said to the first officer: ""At two nautical miles you must be at seven hundred ... we take the decision at three nautical miles, then you will maintain 400 feet radio altimeter"".
After intercepting the final approach, the speed was reduced to 170Kts. At 19:01:51, the Tower controller reported the latest weather information: ""Wind calm, visibility four kilos presence of mist, Overcast at 006, temperature 23, dew point 23, QNH 1016"". The captain replied, ""Roger, continue approach and call back.""
The captain then selected an altitude of 400 ft, while the aircraft was 6.4NM from the runway threshold. Subsequently the crew re-engaged the V/S mode with a vertical speed of -1,200 ft/min when the aircraft was 6.2 NM from the runway threshold.
At 19:02:14, the captain selected flaps to the 15Â° position and radioed Al Hoceima Tower ""Did you copy. We are fully established"", after which ATC acknowledged receipt and issued landing clearance.
The captain then acknowledged ""Roger"". At the request of the first officer, the captain selected the landing gear down, followed by flaps to the 30Â° position at a threshold distance of 3.3 NM.
At 19:03:33, the aircraft was 2 NM from the runway threshold at an altitude of approximately 400 ft. Descent continued at a selected rate of -1800 ft/min, which was later reduced to -1400 ft/min.
After descending through 135 ft over the water, the PF said ""this is not normal"" and at a height of 80 feet and a speed of 130 knots, he disengaged the autopilot (AP).
For 9 seconds, the PF applies nose-up control column forces while the PM applied nose-down control column forces. The maximum opposite force on the two control columns reached 3 times 68 daN. At 19:03:51, the PF advanced the thrust levers to the 74Â° position reached in 4 seconds. At 19:03:53, the landing gear was compressed; the aircraft struck the surface of the water twice because the nose-down forces applied to the control column by the PM were greater than the PF's nose-up forces. On the second impact, the aircraft had a nose-down attitude of -3Â° and experienced a vertical acceleration of 3.92G and a deceleration of 0.42G.
This occurred at 2630 meters from the threshold of runway 17. At this time, the PM applied a 40 daN nose-down force while the PF applied a 28 daN nose-up force.
Subsequently, the PM's nose-down force decreased while the PF's nose-up force increased and the aircraft regained altitude. The Master Warning, associated with a TO config PWR MGT (PWR MGT in CRZ position during the approach), was activated for one second. The thrust levers were moved back to 67Â° and the attitude gradually increased to reach 17Â° to pitch up 10 seconds later.

At 19:03:59, when the aircraft was 1.08 NM from the threshold of runway 17, the captain told the first officer to turn and set the flap selector from 30Â° to 0Â°. The flaps were retracted to the 0Â° position about 14 seconds later at 19:04:05. The landing gear was then retracted, and the captain radioed toe Al Hoceima Tower that they were carrying out a go-around, and requested to proceed to Nador Airport. The crew continued their flight, and landed safely at Nador at 19:30

Probable causes:
- The event that occurred on 9 July 2018 to the aircraft, registration CN-COH, during its approach to Al-Hoceima Charif Al Idrissi Airport, would have been due to failure to comply with operational procedures, in particular; the deliberate stopping of the GPWS, the continuation of the unstable approach below the stabilization level and the continuation of the approach beyond the minimum descent altitude (MDA) in the absence of visual references.
- The undue shutdown of the GPWS and the absence of Advisory Calls during the approach deprived the crew of any opportunity to recognize and manage the undesired Controlled Flight Toward Terrain situation in which the aircraft was until touchdown.
- Item (038-42-02-01) of the Dispatch Deviation Manual, which does not provide an operational instruction (O) for the total GPWS failure, would have supported the flight crew's decision to stop the aircraft without precaution.
- The lack of CRM among the flight crew, particularly in terms of communication, coordination, and appropriate dosage between the captain authority gradient and the first officer's level of assertiveness, resulted in the first officer's delay in reacting against the captain's directives, which were incompatible with the limits of the stabilization level and approach minima.
The fact remains that the first officer's reaction, even if late, limited the final situation to the material damage to the aircraft.

While the aircraft was descending through 11,000 ft in heavy rain, the right engineâ€™s power rolled back (decreased) and the engine flamed out. The engine automatically re-started within five seconds. The descent continued and, while passing through 10,000 ft, the left engineâ€™s power also rolled back and that engine flamed out before automatically relighting. The crew selected manual engine ignition for the remainder of the flight and the landing.
The aircraft re-entered service on December 17.

Contributing factors
- The two engine flameouts were probably the result of the environmental conditions (likely icing and/or heavy/moderate rain) during the flight.
Other factors that increased risk
- The crew selected manual ignition as a preventative measure against further flameout. While ATR recommend that manual ignition should not be selected unless directed by checklist or under minimum equipment list, this was not specifically mentioned in the ATR documentation.

The pilots successfully performed the aborted take-off procedure, controlling the aircraft and stopping it on the runway. After its total stop, the Control Tower (TWR) reported the existence of fire in engine number 2. The crewmembers carried out the procedures of shutting down the engine and fighting the fire, activating the respective fire extinguisher. The commander also shutdown engine number 1 and requested the towing of the aircraft to the apron, where passengers disembarked normally.
The aircraft had minor damage. All crewmembers and passengers left unharmed.

20:52 local time from Penghu Airport to Taichung International Airport, with the captain, the first officer, 2 cabin crews and 72 passengers on board.
The crew completed the approach briefing and descent preparations at about 21:03 hours and started to descend. They executed the runway 36 ILS approach at Taichung Airport. After the plane passed through Changhua, the flight crew found thunderstorms with lighting in front of the route and the destination airport. After discussion, they judged that this situation
would not change shortly, while could contact the ground, the flight crew believed that the visibility would be acceptable. At 21:18 hours, the aircraft landed on runway 36 at Taichung Airport and deviated from the runway during the landing roll. The aircraft and runway facilities were not damaged and the persons on board were safe.

Findings Related to Probable Causes
1. The flight crew did not fully correct the aircraft's left deviation before landing. They did not see the centerline and touched down on the left side of the runway. The appropriate wet runway landing techniques was not applied, and the flight crew did not properly correct the aircraft's left deviation tendency after landing.

During descending, the aircraft experienced cabin altitude anomaly. The flight crew executed an emergency descent and donned oxygen masks. The aircraft safely landed at 15:29. The 6 crewmembers, 1 maintenance personnel and 48 passengers were all safe.

Findings related to probable causes:
Before the aircraft took off from Kaohsiung International Airport, the ground connection check valve might have been malfunctioned and could not be maintained in the fully closed position that caused the connection of the pressurized cabin and atmospheric environment.
While the aircraft descending from cruising altitude, the cabin pressurization system was affected by flight altitude, reduced air intake of the air-conditioning system, and unclosed check valve, failed to provide an appropriate cabin pressure. Consequently, the excessive cabin altitude triggered the cabin altitude waring.

The aircraft operated on a flight from Mandalay to Yangon.
After contacting Yangon Tower, the flight received the latest weather information: ""Heavy rain on the runway, visibility less than 1.2 nm"". Because of heavy rain, the aerodrome operations were suspended.
Consequently, the aircraft entered a the holding over HGUVOR at altitude 10000ft for about 25 minutes. When the visibility over the Yangon International Airport improved, and aircraft were permitted to land. The aircraft descened to 3000ft and was cleared for an ILS approach to runway 21.
ATC instructed to the aircraft to report back when the approach lights were in sight. When the aircraft was about 3.5nm from the runway, the flight crew reported to the ATC that the approach lights were in sight.
When the aircraft was about 1.5 nm from the runway, the rain intensity increased. The co-pilot asked the PIC whether to go around or stabilized. The PIC replied that the runway was insight, so he continued to land the aircraft. The aircraft landed with a nose down attitude on the runway 21. It bounced four times forward and came to stop about 7000 ft from the threshold of runway 21. The nose gear axle had ruptured and the right nose wheel broke off.

Primary Cause
- When the aircraft was on short finals, the power setting was inappropriate and the approach speed exceeded the stabilized approach speed criteria.
- The PIC decided to continue with the landing despite the destabilized approach and being advised to conduct a go-around by the Co-pilot.
- Due to insufficient flare, the nose gear of the aircraft contacted the runway first instead of the main gears in a normal landing. The excessive load on the nose gear as a result of the aircraft's abnormal landing attitude resulted in the nose gear collapsing.

The approach was stabilized until the nose dropped. In the ensuing recovery maneuver, the tail struck the runway.

Causes:
The Aircraft Accident Investigation Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be: excessive pitch-up of the airplane while landing with a tailwind by dual input orders of pilots, which resulted in a tail strike following a bounced landing. The human error arose from the dual input control column on opposite orders, which occurred from altitude of 15 ft. from the runway.

Over the runway threshold the aircraft suddenly sank and the rear fuselage impacted the runway. The aircraft landed and rolled out normally to the parking position. Touchdown was registered at +2.73 G.

Probable cause(s)
Abnormal contact with the runway, consisting of the ventral section of the empennage striking the runway (tail strike) during landing.
Aircraft pitching downward, induced by the crew, at an altitude of approximately 100 feet AGL, coupled with a reduction in engine power of up to 3%, which generated a gradual loss of altitude and lift in the final phase of the approach and hard contact with the runway (hard landing).
Aircraft pitching upward, induced by the crew, above 9.4Â°, due to the loss of altitude in the last segment of the final approach, which caused the tail strike against the runway.
Contributing factor
The tailwind conditions at the time of landing and the high altitude due to the density of the airfield, which increased the ground speed (GS) of the aircraft.

While taxiing to the runway, the flight crew inadvertently lined-up on runway 30. Almost immediately after commencing the take-off roll, and at about the same time air traffic control instructed them to ‘stop’, the flight crew rejected the take‑off. The aircraft was re‑positioned for a departure from runway 35.
The ATSB found that the flight crew elected to depart from intersection ‘Golf’ for runway 35. Due to the close proximity of the aircraft’s parking bay to the ‘Golf’ runway holding point, the selection of this intersection reduced the distance, and therefore the amount of time available for the flight crew to complete their pre-departure checks. After passing through the holding point, the captain taxied the aircraft onto runway 30, following the lead-on lights for that runway, while the first officer’s attention was focussed on completing procedures and checklists. This likely resulted in the flight crew having reduced awareness of the runway environment and aircraft orientation.
The lead-on lights to runway 30 were active with the taxiway lighting and the lead-on lights to runway 35 were activated when the holding point stop bar at intersection ‘Golf’ was turned off by air traffic control. Therefore, both runway lead-on lights were active. This increased the risk of an aircraft being manoeuvred onto the incorrect runway, particularly at night and/or in low visibility conditions. In this case, the captain, who recalled being focused on the lead-on lights, followed the first set of lights that led to runway 30.
The ATSB also established that Virgin Australia Airlines’ ATR72 Before take-off procedure did not specify when ‘ready [for take-off]’ was to be communicated to air traffic control. This increased the risk of procedures and checklists being completed while the aircraft was taxiing onto the runway, at a time when monitoring was critical. Virgin Australia Airlines’ procedures applicable to all the aircraft in their fleet did not include a runway verification check using external cues, including runway markings, signs and/or lights.

The flight crew of the ATR 72 conducted a missed approach to increase separation between the two aircraft.

Contributing factors
â€¢ The pilot of the PA-28 did not sight the ATR aircraft, which the controller had instructed them to follow, and did not advise the controller they did not have the aircraft sighted before turning on to the base leg of the circuit in front of the ATR aircraft, resulting in a near collision.
â€¢ The crew of the ATR were aware that there was traffic in the area but did not assess the position of the PA-28, in relation to their aircraft until activation of the TCAS TA.
â€¢ The controller did not seek confirmation that the pilot of XDI had sighted the ATR before diverting attention to an aircraft outside the circuit area. This interrupted the effective monitoring of the aircraft in the area and the developing near collision was not identified.

22 Jan 2020,ATR 72-600 (72-212A),VH-FVQ,Virgin Australia Airlines,0,"2 km N of Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD/YSSY)",non,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/238772,ATR 72-600,AT76,14:25,1053,Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127M,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 62,0,Serious incident,Initial climb,Passenger - Scheduled,"Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD/YSSY)","Tamworth Airport, NSW (TMW/YSTW)","On the early afternoon of 22 January 2020, a Boeing 777-300ER, registered N2333U, was being operated by United Airlines as regular flight UA870 from Sydney, Australia to San Francisco, United States.
At about the same time, an ATR 72-600, registered VH-FVQ, was being operated by Virgin Australia as regular flight VOZ1153 from Sydney to Tamworth, Australia.
The weather was fine, with excellent visibility, no cloud below 10,000 ft and a light wind from the northwest.
The flight crew for flight UA870 consisted of a captain and three first officers. The captain was the pilot flying (PF) and one of the first officers was the pilot monitoring (PM). The remaining first officers occupied the two observersâ€™ seats positioned directly behind the PF and PM on the flight deck.
Sydney air traffic control attempt to facilitate expeditious departures to all aircraft, particularly aircraft transiting over extended distances (oceanic crossings). This regularly involves a clearance via the SYDNEY ONE RADAR (SYD1) standard instrument departure (SID). The PF had operated from Sydney Airport on a number of other occasions. While preparing for departure at the gate, after receiving the ATIS, but prior to receiving their pre-departure clearance, the PF configured the flight management computer (FMC) for the SYD1 based on an expectation from prior experience.
At about 13:30 local time, Sydney clearance delivery (SCD) air traffic control (ATC) provided a different pre-departure clearance via VHF radio: ""United eight seventy, delivery, cleared to San Francisco via DIPSO, flight planned route, runway three four left (34L), Richmond five departure, radar transition, climb via SID to five thousand ..."".
The PM provided a truncated read back of the clearance to ATC, inadvertently not repeating the radar transition component.
At the same time as the UA870 crew were preparing for their departure, VOZ1153 was cleared to depart via the SYD1 radar SID via runway 34R. This procedure required the ATR 72 to maintain a heading of 350Âº after take-off, until directed otherwise by ATC.
The UA870 crew reviewed the RICHMOND FIVE (RIC5) SID chart. That chart included two distinct caution notes about the initial climb. The more detailed caution stated: ""Parallel runway operations - DO NOT TURN RIGHT. Track 335Â°. At 1500 [ft] turn LEFT, track direct RIC NDB [Richmond], then follow transition instruction. ""
The PF then re-programmed the FMC, replacing the SYD1 procedure with the RIC5. At this point, the PF reported being unsure regarding the coding specific to the two transition options (radar or Richmond) presented by the FMC.
The radar transition option in the FMC included a deliberate discontinuity (gap) in the waypoint sequence (coding). The discontinuity represented the point where air traffic control would provide radar vectors to facilitate a re-join to the oceanic track (to San Francisco) after the aircraft passed 12 NM from Sydney.
The PF then closed (removed) the discontinuity. In effect, the PF had removed the preprogrammed radar transition procedure, which meant that after the 1,500 ft left turn, the next waypoint on the route was DIPSO, not 12 NM Sydney. The PF recalled communicating removing the discontinuity to the PM, but it was not acknowledged by the PM. The PM did not recall hearing about the coding change.
Later in the pre-departure preparation, the PM reported verifying the new departure in the FMC using the summary route (RTE) page. However, the PM did not review it using the more detailed LEGS page.
While taxiing to the runway for take-off, the PM recalled that when completing the departure review with the PF, they noted the FMC RTE page read: Runway 34L, Richmond Five (RIC5), no transition
At 14:21:41 the tower controller for runway 34R cleared VOZ1153 for take-off, and 42 seconds later, the tower controller for runway 34L cleared UA870 for take-off.
At 14:22:29, VOZ1153 departed runway 34R. About 35 seconds later, as VOZ1153 was climbing through 1,500 ft, UA870 departed runway 34L. (The runway 34L threshold is about 1,000 m north [ahead] of the runway 34R threshold)
At about 14:24:06, climbing through 1,417 ft, the UA870 crew were instructed to contact Sydney departures control.
At 14:24:33, as UA870 was climbing through 2,120 ft, the Sydney departures controller detected that the aircraft was turning right and instructed the crew to immediately turn left, to a heading of 270Â°. The flight crew had also identified the incorrect turn to the right. The departures controller then issued a separate interventional instruction to VOZ1153 to turn right immediately, to a heading of 090Â°.
On receiving their instruction, the two UA870 pilots in the observersâ€™ seats identified the traffic (VOZ1153) visually (right-hand observer) and via the traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS) display (left-hand observer).
Recorded flight data showed that the UA870 autopilot was disengaged about 3 seconds after the interventional instruction to UA870 was received, at an altitude of 2,160 ft. Due to the momentum of the 777, the aircraft continued turning right through a further 5 degrees to heading 018Âº, prior to the PF manually reversing the turn back to the left. The minimum distance between the two aircraft was 1.0 NM laterally and 200 ft vertically. Both aircraft continued flight to their respective destinations without further incident.


Findings
Contributing factors
â€¢ The pilot flying incorrectly amended the flight management computer (FMC) for the cleared departure.
â€¢ The amended FMC setup was probably not effectively communicated to the crew or effectively cross-checked by the pilot monitoring or relief pilots.
Other factors increasing risk
â€¢ The pilot monitoring did not complete a full readback of the radar transition component of the pre-departure clearance, nor did the Sydney clearance delivery controller insist on a full readback.

A similar incident occurred to ATR 72-600 G-ORAI on 22 July 2020. Both incidents were the subject of a combined AAIB Investigation, published on 13 May 2021. The following is the part of the investigation that specifically refers to G-OATR on 29 June 2020:

""Synopsis
Two separate cabin smoke events were reported while starting the engines on different aircraft in the operatorâ€™s fleet. The operator concluded that low utilisation of the aircraft and a high amount of airborne salinity resulted in corrosion forming on the P2.5/P3 engine air switching valve, sufficient to prevent it from fully closing. With the valve partially open, contaminated air from the engine was able to enter the cabin.

Safety action has been taken by the operator to help prevent corrosion forming on the valve and to amend the engine start procedure to reduce the risk of contaminated air entering the environmental control system.

History of the flight (G-OATR)
As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the utilisation of the operatorâ€™s fleet had reduced significantly. In line with the engine manufacturerâ€™s recommended practice for running the engines, the operator scheduled their aircraft to fly at least every 14 days. G-OATR had last flown 10 days prior to the event.

G-OATR was scheduled to fly from Guernsey Airport to Southampton Airport. The crew started both engines and the aircraft was pushed back from the stand. As the tug was being detached from the aircraft, the flight crew received a call from the Senior Cabin Crew Member (SCCM) who stated that there was a â€œfaint haze or smokeâ€ in the cabin. Shortly afterwards the SCCM reported that its intensity was increasing. There was no smoke or haze visible in the cockpit.

The commander turned off the cabin air recirculation fans when he was first alerted of smoke in the cabin and when he was informed that the intensity was increasing, he shut down both engines. The co-pilot reviewed the QRH for an applicable checklist, however, there was no procedure for â€˜smoke on groundâ€™. The flight crew and the SCCM agreed to rapidly disembark the passengers through the rear cabin door and a PAN call was made to ATC informing them of this decision. Once all the passengers had disembarked, the crew departed via the cabin door and liaised with the AFRS who were on scene"". (G-OATR had 56 on board - 6 crew plus 50 passengers)

AAIB Conclusion
The operator determined that the smoke and haze in the cabin was due to the partial seizing of the P2.5/P3 air switching valves, which allowed oil vapour to enter the ECS. Corrosion was found in all the valves, which probably resulted from the reduced utilisation of the aircraft due to the corona virus pandemic, and the aircraft being parked and operated from an airfield close to the sea where there was a relatively high level of airborne salinity.

Safety actions
Following the events on G-OATR and G-ORAI, the following safety actions were taken:

The operator:
â— Introduced a requirement for engine ground runs to be carried out on aircraft that have not flown for three days to ensure the correct operation of the bleed air system and ECS.
â— Introduced an inspection of the P2.5/P3 air switching valves every 42 days and replacement of the piston ring every 100 days.
â— Issued a â€˜Notice to Crewâ€™ to require flight crews and maintenance personnel to start the engines with the bleed air system and ECS selected off.

The engine manufacturer:
â— Updated the EMM to include an inspection of the P2.5/P3 air switching valves following a period of storage, irrespective of duration and environment.
â— Issued a requirement to replace the P2.5/P3 air switching valves during engine overhaul.
â— Initiated a redesign of the P2.5/P3 air switching valve, which will consider the materials used in the valve assembly

At 0400 UTC (13:00 LT) the aircraft took off and after the aircraft became airborne, the pilot verified the Idle Gate lever was engaged. Suddenly all 5 Display Units (DU) and the Integrated Electronic Standby Instrument (IESI) went blank and all of the Very High Frequency (VHF) radios were off. The landing gear could not be selected up. The pilot flew the aircraft visually. After about 1 minute, the pilot heard communication on the radio and the DUs were intermittently recovered. The cross marks (X) appeared on the indicator of speed and altitude on DU 1, DU 5 and IESI. The landing gear lever could be selected to up. The engine set from takeoff power to climb power and the pilot continued with performing after takeoff check list including retracted the flaps and maintained speed at 170 knots.
The pilot attempted to land and followed the ILS approach procedure. The weather deteriorated and the pilot decided to perform a go-around. The flight held over AUDRI for about 90 minutes at 7,000 feet and continued for 20 minutes at 5,000 feet waiting for weather improvement.
After the weather improved the aircraft landed safely at 0600 UTC. No one was injured in this occurrence and the aircraft was undamaged."

As the aircraft turned onto the final approach path, the crew shut down Engine No.2. While establishing on final approach, the crew pulled the respective Fire Handle for Engine No.2 and subsequently discharged the extinguishing agent No.1 while passing 500 ft AGL. As the aircraft was passing through 100ft, the fire warning went off. About 25 seconds later the crew
discharged agent No. 2, completing the procedure.


The investigation determined that the aircraft did not sustain an Engine No.2 fire. The Operatorâ€™s post occurrence maintenance records and statements also confirmed that there were no defects identified by their engineers to indicate an engine fire. The engine was found to be serviceable, and the aircraft was released back to service.
The engine fire warning and alarm observed by the crew on the day was, instead, an undue alarm. The investigation confirmed that the false alarm activation was a result of the aircraft being on a steep descent, in the landing configuration with power at flight idle. These were the flight condition criteria specified by the Manufacturer as conducive to an engine fire warning. The nacelle ventilation reduced causing the nacelle temperature to increase. When the temperature increased and reached the engine fire warning specifications, the fire warning alarm was triggered

The copilot was Pilot Flying.
The flight was cleared for an RNP approach to runway 21. At 10:05 the aircraft was at 958 feet and passed the minimum descent height. The flight reported runway in sight and continued the approach.
At a distance of 1.5 nm from the runway threshold, the aircraft dropped below the glide slope.
At 10:06:14, at about 0.15 nm from the runway, the pilot called ""come and go around"", and two seconds later, the autopilot was disconnected. Four seconds later the main landing gear and tail skid struck the top of a concrete perimeter wall
The flight crew continued the missed approach procedure and radioed that they suspected damage to the nose landing gear.
At 10:08, the flight crew requested to return to Songshan Airport.
Suspecting damage to the nose gear, the flight crew first flew a low pass over runway 10 at 10:45 hours. The tower controller at Songshan Airport reported observing damage to the right main gear wheels. The pilot decided to fly the traffic circuit with the gear down and landed on runway 10 at 11:07 hours.
The aircraft and the runway surface were damaged but there were no injuries.

Findings Related to Probable Cause:
When the occurrence aircraft performed a non-precision approach to runway 21 of Nangan Airport, the pre-threshold area was obscured by low clouds or marine fog. During the final approach, the pilot flying used the autopilot lateral navigation and vertical speed mode for the approach.
Focusing on flight operations in the cockpit, the pilot flying lost situational awareness of the aircraft position and did not realize that the aircraft altitude was very close to the runway threshold elevation. When the aircraft entered low clouds and was unable to maintain visual contact with the runway, the pilot flying did not follow the procedure of immediate execution of a go-around but continued using the autopilot for the approach, the pilot monitoring did not remind the pilot flying to execute or call for a go-around. When the pilot flying decided to perform a go-around, the aircraft had reached an altitude of 229 ft, 11 ft above the runway threshold elevation. Because the altitude was too low, before the aircraft could establish an effective positive rate of climb, the aircraftÂ’s main wheels and tail skid collided with the top outer edge of the pre-threshold area of runway 21, causing substantial damage to the aircraft.

The crew controlled the aircraft and managed to steer it back on the runway axis.
Subsequently, the aircraft continued taxiing and departed along taxiway A5 towards position F5, where it stopped.
No injuries were reported. The aircraft sustained minor damage to the landing gear due to the partial excursion, and caused damage to two runway edge lights.
The serious incident occurred at 17:27, in daylight, adverse weather conditions with heavy precipitation, reduced visibility and a wet runway.


Probable Cause:
Execution of a landing after an unstabilized approach, with out-of-bounds parameters, which occurred during the last leg of the approach (300 feet AGL), which were not adequately resolved by the crew, causing the aircraft to skid after touchdown, and partial excursion along the right margin of the runway.
Contributing Factors:
- Increased approach speed up to Vapp+19 knots, and increased descent rate up to -1166 ft/min at 300 ft AGL.
- Deteriorated weather conditions during approach and landing, related to heavy precipitation and reduced visibility.
- Wet runway condition on the airfield.
- Operation of the airfield under adverse weather conditions of heavy precipitation and wind shear that after the serious incident became hazardous for takeoff and landing maneuvers.
- Crew overconfidence in deciding to continue the approach and landing maneuver under adverse weather conditions that were constantly warned in the cockpit, reported by other aircraft and ATC.

The captain of the flight was Pilot Flying, the copilot was Pilot Monitoring.
During approach to Hubli, the aircraft was cleared to land on runway 26. The aircraft touched down on the runway and bounced four times. All four touchdowns were hard, the first was a three point landing and on the subsequent three landings, the nose landing gear touched the runway first. After the fourth touchdown the crew initiated a go-around. During the go-around, the landing gear unsafe warning was displayed 20 seconds. However, this went unnoticed by the crew. Subsequently, when the landing gears were selected up, the landing gear unsafe indication cleared automatically. Thereafter, the aircraft climbed as per instructions of ATC Hubli and entered a holding pattern.
During the second approach to the same runway 26, when the landing gears were selected down, the landing gear unsafe warning was displayed again, which was noticed by the crew. As there were three green indications on the primary display and one red indication for the nose landing gear on on the overhead panel, the crew disregarded the unsafe indication as per QRH procedure. Checklists were carried out and the landing phase was initiated. After second approach, the aircraft again touched down on runway 26 and bounced consecutively three times, before coming to rest on the runway after the fourth touchdown.

Probable Cause: The probable cause of this accident is attributed to inappropriate aircraft landing technique and not
following the bounced landing recovery procedure i.e., delayed flare, high speed at touchdown and delay in initiating a ""Go-Around"".
Contributory factors for this accident were lack of situational awareness and lack of commitment to initiate a ""Go-Around"" after experiencing a significant bounce.

Contributory Factors
Weather and actions of cabin and the cockpit crew in not following the laid down SOP were the contributory factors that led to the accident.
Probable causes of the accident
1. The weather en-route TRZ â€“ BLR was turbulent, since Weather Radar detects only water droplets and not dry air turbulence. If tilt management is not appropriate pilots could misinterpret the weather target displayed and could inadvertently minimize convective thunderstorm.
2. Anticipating turbulent weather the crew switched â€˜ONâ€™ the seat belts sign, but failed to announce over PA or inform the cabin crew of possible turbulence ahead.
3. The cabin crew too did not enquire from the Captain the reason for the Seat belts signs ON. This is a serious communication failure between the cockpit and cabin crew. Indigo airlines addressed this issue by carrying out amendments in their safety and emergency manual, SEA, Part Three Section 3.12, Turbulence dated 15 September 2021 after this accident.
4. The sudden drop in altitude by 250 feet, owing to the turbulence when the aircraft
encountered weather, led to the cabin crew L1, falling down and getting her leg fractured. The cause of the accident was aircraft entering turbulent weather and both the Cockpit Crew and Cabin crew not following assigned SOPs, while flying through Turbulence.

Tambo International Airport (JNB/FAOR),Gaborone-Sir Seretse Khama International Airport (GBE/FBSK),"Air Botswana flight BP204, an ATR 72-600 was involved in a serious incident during the climb phase from O.R. Tambo
International Airport (FAOR). At flight level 80 (FL80), the torque had 8% fluctuations and the Interstage Turbine Temperature (ITT) had increased by approximately 40°C on engine number 2 parameters.
At FL140, the ENG 2 fire warning illuminated, and the crew shut down engine number 2. The crew returned to FAOR and landed safely on runway 03L.
Post-incident inspection of engine number 2 revealed that the exhaust pipe, turbine blades, exit vanes and handling bleed valve (HBV) electrical connector were damaged. Exhaust pipe metal pieces were discovered at the bottom cowling.

The incident aircraft resumed service on January 25, 2022.


Probable Causes
During the climb phase, three PT2 blades of the hot section of ENG 2 fractured on the chromium-coated section; this led to the failure of the three blades in-flight which subsequently caused other failures in the engine and, thus, the crew’s decision to shut down the engine.
Contributory Factor
The three chromium plated PT2 blades were subjected to sulphidation which led to the fracture during operation.

When the AOA reached 11.5Â°, the autopilot disengaged, the ailerons immediately deflected to about 12,5Â° and the aircraft rolled to the left to an 80Â° maximum bank angle. The maximum aileron deflection was recorded at 12.5Â°.
Recovery was achieved by a prompt reaction of the crew, which applied maximum power and brought the wings back to a level position by quickly positioning the ailerons opposite to the initial roll upset. The loss of altitude was 600 feet.

On April 7, 1989, the FAA issued AD 89-09-05, which prohibited the use of the autopilot in icing conditions. The FAA determined during its investigation that the autopilot masked an asymmetric ice buildup, and the airplane rolled when the autopilot disconnected. This AD was later superseded by a new AD which removed the autopilot restriction following the installation of vortex generators to improve roll control of the airplane.

NTSB Probable Cause: ""Stall induced by the accretion of moderate to severe clear icing.""

Both aircraft were operating in accordance with instrument flight rules and were being provided with radar vectors for their respective approaches. The aircraft, while on their assigned headings, conflicted one mile southeast of the final approach path of runway 24 Left.

The Transportation Safety Board of Canada determined that the cause of the risk of collision was the untimely takeover of communications at the arrival position by the instructor and the untimely opening of the low-arrival position to relieve the arrival position of excess workload. The absence of procedures, general guidelines, and supervisor training concerning the opening/closing of control positions and the management of control staff likely contributed to this occurrence."

The aircraft operated on a flight from Dublin with the a new captain undergoing his first session of line training after a simulator conversion programme. He was Pilot Not Flying (PNF) on this leg. The Pilot Flying (PF) was a senior Training Captain. The taxiing of the aircraft however was accomplished by the PNF in the left seat as the nosewheel steering system hand wheel was on the left side of the flight deck. During the taxi out for departure from Dublin, the take-off configuration test was carried out and it was noted that the No 2 DC generator had failed. The crew stopped the aircraft on the taxiway and attempted to reset the generator. They also checked the aircraft's Minimum Equipment List (MEL) in order to ascertain whether it was acceptable to operate the aircraft with one DC generator off-line. In the event, the generator was restored, and the aircraft took off at 13:47 hrs. Shortly after departure, the No 2 DC generator again failed. The appropriate checklist was carried out for the DC Gen 2 Fault, which simply involved the switching off of the affected generator. There were no other actions required in the checklist. Apart from crew consideration of possible expeditious en route diversion airfields in the event of a second generator failure, the flight to Gatwick was uneventful, and the aircraft landed on runway 08R at 15:02.
The aircraft vacated the runway on No 2 rapid exit turnoff and was cleared to taxi to Stand 3 routing via the Alpha Exit link. The company's normal operating checklist, and that of the manufacturer, called for the No 1 engine to be shut down as part of the after landing drills, once a one minute cooling period had been observed. Nothing in the abnormal checklist for a DC Gen Fault contradicted this procedure. When the left engine is feathered during taxi on this type of aircraft, there is a tendency for the aircraft to initially swing to the right. The left seat pilot therefore suggested that the feathering action be taken as the aircraft approached the natural right turn after passing through the Alpha Exit.
This was accomplished, and the left propeller was feathered. In order to enable the engineers to carry out an accurate engine oil contents check during the turnaround, the left engine was kept running with the propeller feathered. The usual procedure prior to this check requires a further period of 20 seconds before engine shutdown. In the event, a period of 35 seconds elapsed prior to engine shutdown. The apron surface was damp. The toe brakes were checked for effectiveness by the left seat pilot, prior to turning onto the stand centreline of Stand 3, and he proceeded under marshalling guidance towards the appropriate stop position. On receiving the stop signal from the ground crew, the left seat pilot applied the toe brakes, but these were ineffective. He notified the other pilot of the problem, and proceeded to apply reverse thrust to the right engine. The commander also applied his toe brakes, to no effect. The PF then reached across and pulled the emergency/parking brake handle, located on the left side of the power lever quadrant, but this action, along with the initiation of reverse thrust, occurred too late to prevent the right propeller from striking the ground power unit (GPU) which had been pre-positioned to the front right side of the normal parking position in order to allow expeditious connection to the aircraft's ground power socket. The collision occurred some 30 seconds after the shutdown of the left engine.
The two ground crew, who were in position to meet the aircraft, observed that a collision was imminent and began to run clear of the area. Debris from the impact struck one of the crew men and narrowly missed the other. Fortunately, neither sustained injuries from the debris.

The co-pilot was flying the aircraft. The ATR 42 was cleared to climb to flight level 210 and proceed on airway V372 to the Mirabel VOR. Shortly after take-off, the crew engaged the autopilot (A/P) at 3000 feet above sea level (asl).
The climb was routine up to about 17000 feet asl, when a violent explosion rocked the aircraft and the cabin depressurized. The CONTINUOUS REPETITIVE CHIME warning sounded in the cockpit, and at the same time the master warning light and cabin excessive altitude light illuminated. The crew observed that the right engine parameters indicated a total loss of power.
Nine seconds after the depressurization, the pilot-in-command assumed control of the aircraft and disengaged the A/P. He aborted the climb, commenced a descent, and maintained speed. The engine failure procedure and single engine checklist were completed during the descent. The co-pilot contacted Montreal Area Control Centre (ACC) and advised the controller that the aircraft had experienced an engine failure and requested clearance to descend to 15,000 feet, then to 11,000 feet.
The co-pilot pulled fire handle No. 2 after visually confirming the damage to the engine and observing a fuel leak. The cabin excessive altitude checklist was then completed. Three minutes after the occurrence, the crew declared an emergency with the Montreal ACC.
About seven minutes after the cabin depressurization, the co-pilot visually confirmed the structural damage in the cabin. The pilot-in-command felt it was preferable to minimize the number of turns in order to reduce the risk of further structural damage. After noting the damage and assessing the situation, the pilot-in-command decided to continue the flight to Dorval. At that time, the aircraft was 36 minutes flying time from Val D'Or, 39 minutes from Mirabel and 44 minutes from Dorval.
At 10:28, the aircraft initiated a descent toward 9000 feet asl and maintained that altitude, which was above the cloud layer, until it entered the Montreal terminal zone. The aircraft was aligned with the ILS for Dorval runway 06L by radar vectors. It landed without further incident at 11:16.

An investigation showed that the top of the No. 2 blade had failed and punctured the fuselage as the blade passed on its trajectory toward and beneath the aircraft. A vertical cut measuring 104 cm by 2.5 cm was observed between stations 9157 and 9333 on the right side of the fuselage. The seat adjacent to the vertical cut was partially cut. Two landing gear hydraulic lines mounted under the floor were slightly bent.

Causes: ""Corrosion pitting had occurred on the surface of the taper bore of the No. 2 blade as a result of water combining with chlorine deposits on the cork in the taper bore. The chlorine was associated with the bleaching of the corks during their manufacture. One of the corrosion pits was the point of origin of the fatigue cracks that caused the propeller blade to fracture.""

The crew performed a visual approach. As the nose wheel touched the runway surface and reverse thrust was selected, the crew felt that the aircraft trajectory was deviating to the right. At a distance of approximately 550 meters from threshold 07, the aircraft veered off the runway to the right side with a constant trajectory and stopped 200 meters from the end of the runway at 90 meters laterally. The nose landing gear collapsed during the runway excursion. The emergency evacuation was through the front exits. Eight passengers were slightly injured or shocked. The right main landing gear and the nose landing gear were damaged.

The probable cause of this accident is the landing performed with a NP selected at 77% on both propellers instead 100% as required by the 'before landing' checklist. With NP selected at 77%, a temporary mismatch in blade angle due to the tolerance condition of the PCU, can quickly lead to a propeller thrust asymmetry of about 1400 daN and to the veering to the right of the aircraft. The use of the nose wheel steering instead of the rudder and the poor cockpit crew co-operation during the final approach were factors contributing to the accident.

The captain briefed the flight attendant on the expected turbulence for the entire flight and kept the seatbelt sign illuminated continuously. Turbulence was encountered for the majority of the flight. Radar vectors were provided for an LDA Runway 26L approach to Honolulu. Also, a descent was made to 7,000 feet with the aircraft heading toward the only clear area between cells shown on both the aircraft and approach control radars. No turbulence had been encountered for several minutes, and the flight attendant elected to do a passenger/seat belt compliance check. The captain said three strong 'jolts' were encountered, accompanied by altitude excursions. The turbulence was encountered as the attendant was returning to her seat in the rear of the aircraft. The flight attendant was bounced off the ceiling twice and sustained a displaced fracture of her left ankle.

Probable Cause: the flight attendant's decision to leave her seat in an area of forecast and known moderate turbulence. The turbulence was a related factor.

Examination of the landing gear revealed that the barrel lugs (used to attach the swinging lever to the main landing gear barrel) had failed. The fracture of the outboard lower lug exhibited clam shell marks typical of a fatigue crack. The fatigue crack emanated from a corrosion pit in the bore of the lug. The four bushings for the lower lugs of the barrel (replaced during overhaul) did not have the proper interference fit. The bushings did not have the proper applications of corrosion preventative applied to the surface of the bushings. Primer paint had not been applied during overhaul, and Mastinox was used instead of the wet primer that the manufacturer's procedures specified. During the course of the investigation, nine landing gears (with various numbers of total cycles since overhaul or manufacture) were inspected. The inspections revealed torn or missing rubber sealant used on bushing flanges, corrosion in the lug bores, and corrosion on the lug faces.

Probable Cause: improper use of procedures by maintenance personnel at an overhaul facility during overhaul of the landing gear, allowing corrosion to occur on the barrel lugs of the landing gear, which subsequently led to fatigue cracking of the lugs and eventual collapse of the gear.

everything was all right. Approaching a bend in the taxiway, the first officer was again concerned
with the closeness of the aircraft to the grass verge and he brought this also to the commander's
attention. The commander recollects the first officer pointing out the proximity of the verge and
other obstacles but nonetheless he continued to turn the aircraft until he was advised by ATC that he
had run over a lamp at the edge of the taxiway and that one of the tires had deflated. After the
passengers had disembarked, the first officer and flight attendant observed an apparent drowsiness
and lack of coordination on the part of the commander and arranged for medical attention.
Subsequent medical diagnosis of the commander revealed a condition which was likely to have

The captain stated that after turning south on NK, he taxied the airplane towards the IAB terminal, and saw what appeared to be a hard surface ramp to the left and right of the airplane and he proceeded to make a left turn believing that he was now taxiing on the IAB ramp. The captain reported that the airport diagram on the Jeppesen charts showed the intersection of NK and the IAB ramp to be a 'T' or 90 degree turn, but in reality, the intersection is constructed at a 45 degree angle to the left of taxiway NK which joins the IAB ramp. The pilot further stated that no lights were available to outline the edge of the ramp area. He added that he continued to taxi in an east direction, believing that he was on the IAB ramp. According to the airport's operations personnel, the taxiway is properly marked with a solid center line and the area is bordered by a double yellow line delineating the edge of the taxiway. Additionally, at the time of the accident, recessed taxiway lights were in place to further delineate the edge of the taxiway.

Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to follow the proper taxi route while taxiing back to the terminal. A factor was the glare radiating from the airport's terminal area.

The aircraft took off from Nice-CÃ´te d'Azur Airport (NCE), France, on a flight to FLR. The Pilot Flying in the left seat was a captain undergoing training. The instructor pilot and Pilot Not Flying was seated on the right.
The climbing and cruising phases were uneventful.
During the approach, the Tower controller cleared the flight to land on runway 05. The instructor captain then requested an approach to runway 23 for training purposes. This was authorized by the Tower controller.
The pilots then proceeded downwind and prepared for a Circle-to-Land approach. They were keeping an altitude of 2500 feet until the base leg.
During the base turn, the PNF selected the flaps to 35Â° and urged the PF the push the nose down. In the descending turn the GPWS sounded multiple times with 'Sink Rate' and 'Pull up' warnings.
The aircraft then crossed the threshold with an indicated speed of about 145 kts.

The aircraft touched down for the first time about 450 m from the touchdown zone and bounced twice.
At a speed of about 104 kts and at less than 350 m from the end of the available runway, the aircraft put its wheels firmly on the runway. Braking was applied immediately,
The aircraft continued across the grassy terrain until it crashed into the airport net-fencing at the edge of the A11 motorway, and the aircraft came to a complete standstill, with the left engine still running.

CAUSES
The crew planned and carried out the MVL (Circle-to-Land) approach which took the aircraft to an approach flight path incompatible with respect to the safety parameters set down by the company standards.
Despite the activation of the alarm systems, the expected go-around manoeuvre was not started also because of an insufficient crew coordination between the two flight crew members.
The presence of a significant wind component from the north cannot be completely excluded, which further destabilized the spatial flight path of the aircraft.

Three flagmen were helping the pilot with the manoeuvers. One was posted in front of the aircraft and the other two flagmen were posted behind the wings. Near the terminal, the aircraft was supposed to turn left. According to the crew, the brakes were applied after noticing the lack of space between the right wing and the building. The pilot released the brakes and the aircraft continued forward after the flagman near the terminal and the right wing indicated there was enough space. The tip of the ailerons hit the airport terminal and suffered major damages.

When the flighcrew attempted to reset the No. 1 generator, the No. 2 generator also failed. Attempts to reset either of the generators were unsuccessful and after about 1 minute the main battery failed. The flightcrew switched to the emergency battery and made a precautionary landing. Postlanding examination showed the No. 1 generator had failed due to failure of the field excitation wire lug which was caused by improper installation of the wire. The aircraft was on the second flight since the No. 1 generator was changed. The No. 2 generator operated normally in postlanding tests. The main battery was found to be discharged. The battery was returned to service after charging. After the incident the aircraft continued to discharge the main battery and the engine start switch was found defective causing the main battery to discharge.

Probable Cause: The failure of the No. 1 generator field excitation return wire terminal lug due to improper installation of the field excitation return wire by maintenance personnel; the subsequent failure of the No. 2 generator due to overvoltage, caused by the momentary closure of the No. 1 generator contactor, as a result of the flight crew's attempt to reset the No. 1 generator, while an overvoltage condition existed at its POR, due to the shorted failure of the No. 1 GCU diode CR17; and the rapid failure of the aircraft's main battery, accelerated by its existing depleted condition, following an extended period of inadequate charging, due to a damaged electrical system.

The ground handler disconnected the electrical cable, closed the airplane's ground service access door, wound the cable and stored it on its GPU mounted rack. She then proceeded directly to the right side nose area, made eye contact with the first officer, and bent down to pull the nose wheel chocks. When she pulled the forward chock, the right nose tire passed over her foot, and the aircraft rolled forward. Observing the mishap, the second ground handler ran over to pick her off the ground and they both ran forward trying to give the flight crew the emergency stop signal. The airplane continued forward about 10 to 15 feet until collision by the No. 2 propeller with the top of the GPU. The propeller was in high rpm at the time of the propeller strike. Fragments of propeller blade impacted the right side fuselage and the sudden stoppage fractured the No. 2 engine case, causing a fuel leak. A fire was ignited by flame droplets falling from the No. 2 engine intake to puddled up jet fuel under the engine and main landing gear area developed. One of the four propeller blades separated from its hub and all four blades sustained tip damage. The spinner was torn as a result of the blade separation. The propeller collision caused metal and composite fragments to impact and dent the right side fuselage. Although the aircraft is still on the US Register, the plane was reported withdrawn from use and used for spares.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's failure to verify that the parking brake was applied prior to engine start, and the resultant inadvertent movement of the aircraft and collision with the ground power cart once No. 2 was started.""

Night instrument meteorological conditions with a visibility of 1/2 sm in snow and freezing fog prevailed at the time of the accident. Flight 4047 was cleared for the ILS 28 approach and began its descent at a point 1.6 nm inbound from the outer marker. While on the final approach segment, the airplane reached a descent rate of 2,000 fpm and the alerts defining the outer and inner envelopes of the ground proximity warning system sounded. During the descent, the airplane's indicated airspeed varied from 160 knots to 122.8 knots. The flight crew briefed an icing approach speed of 123 knots with the first officer acting as the flying pilot. Fifty-six seconds prior to touchdown, air traffic control (ATC) issued winds 070 degrees at 17 knots with a runway 28 Mu of 82,85,81 and chemically treated thin loose snow over patchy ice. The tailwind component was 14.722 knots. The first officer transferred the flight controls to the captain at approximately 400-500 feet agl. Two seconds prior to touchdown, ATC issued winds 060 degrees at 20 knots. The tailwind component was 15.320 knots. The southern runway lights extending from 2,574 feet - 3,311 feet down the runway were damaged. Flight data recorder information indicated that flight 4047 touched down in a 7 degree left bank attitude. American Eagle had in place 'stabilized approach criteria' to define conditions which required a mandatory missed approach. The American Eagle Aircraft Operating Manual stated that the limiting tailwind component for the airplane was 10 knots. Following the accident, an AE crew chief stated that the #1 MLG tire was peeled off the rim and 'ripped up bad.' He described the #2 MLG tire as having side ways scuff marks on the treaded portion of the tire. He stated that he performed an A/S test and if it was bad that he would have entered it into the minimum equipment list. The aircraft received a ferry permit, after the accident, to be flown to Marquette for repair. The ferry captain reported that he flew the aircraft from TVC to Marquette. Prior to leaving the gate, he tested the antiskid (A/S) system and one of the fault lights came on momentarily in which the captain described the duration as 'just a blink'. The Captain then executed a high speed taxi, braked and then stopped the aircraft. He then tested the A/S light, and no light illuminated. He also reported that there were no problems en route or upon landing at Marquette. He added that there was no fault light illumination during or after landing at Marquette.

Probable Cause: The crew's failure to execute a missed approach and the flying pilot's (captain) failure to maintain directional control upon touchdown with a seven degree left bank and a right quartering tailwind. Factor's were the snow covered runway/landing area and the night conditions.

The plane was at an altitude of 1400 meters and turning left with a 30deg bank when it was crashed into a hill (30% slope), 15 meters below the summit.
The weather conditions with Pristina were 5 000 meters horizontal visibility, a sky covered with 700 meters and a compact layer of clouds to 920 meters.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The collision of Flight KSV 3275 with high ground was due :
- to teamwork which lacked procedural discipline and vigilance during maneuvers in a mountainous region with poor visibility.
- to the aircraft being kept on its track and then forgotten by a military controller unused to the mountainous environment of the aerodrome and to preventing the risk of collisions with high ground, within the framework of the radar service he was providing.
- to the operator's critical situation as a new company highly dependant on the lease contract, favoring a failure to respect procedures.
- to the opening of the aerodrome to civil traffic without an advance evaluation of the operating conditions or of the conditions for distribution of aeronautical information.

The following factors contributed to the accident :
- crew fatigue, favoring a lowering of vigilance.
- undertaking the flight with an unserviceable or disconnected GPWS.

Following take-off from Runway 23 at Teesside at 0719 hrs, the cruising altitude of 19,000 feet was reached around 20 minutes later, with all flight deck indications remaining normal. At this point the flight deck crew was informed by the cabin crew member that a passenger had reported a panel missing from the No 1 engine. The cabin crew member also noted that she had heard a noise during take-off, which she had attributed to movement of baggage in the aft compartment.
The flight deck crew could see from the flight deck that part of the No 1 engine outboard cowl door was broken off and decided to return to Teesside. They informed ATC of a slight technical problem and were radar vectored back to the airport, limiting the airspeed to 180 kt to minimise the possibility of additional damage. The crew declined to declare an emergency but ATC placed the airport emergency services at local standby. During final approach the crew spotted a panel on Runway 23, near its threshold. The aircraft overflew the panel and landed without further incident.
A cowl door and a number of pieces of smaller debris were found on the runway near to the point at which G-ORFH had started its take-off run. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. No other aircraft had operated from the runway between the time of G-ORFH's take-off and landing.

While awaiting connection to the GPUÂ¹, the captain, who had already shut down the left engine during taxiing, kept engine no. 2 running but placed the propeller in feathered position. This allowed the propeller rotation to eventually stop while maintaining the supply of electrical power generated by the engine until the transfer to the GPU could be completed.

A ground handling employee (PORTWAY) placed a chock on the nose wheel and went to retrieve another chock to place on the right main landing gear wheel. When he returned to the aircraft, he approached the main gear by passing between the right engine and the fuselage, without paying attention to the propeller, which was still rotating (by inertia). As he crossed the propeller's rotation plane, he was struck by one of the blades, causing a cranial trauma that threw him to the ground. Although he received prompt medical assistance, he did not survive the injuries and passed away.


Primary Cause
The accident resulted from the execution of a wheel chocking procedure on the right main landing gear of the aircraft while the right engine was running and its propeller was still rotating. The victim chose a dangerous path contrary to the best practices recommended for this procedure, instead of following the safe route advised by safety standards.

Contributing Causes
The following factors are considered contributory to this accident:

1. The fact that the propeller was still rotating and its feathered position did not facilitate its visibility to anyone approaching from the front;
2. The limited importance given to safety factors and standards in the content of the training course provided.Hereâ€™s the English translation:

The flight crew was advised of a heading to fly which led the airplane into a cloud that was not depicted on the weather avoidance radar. ""In this cloud we encountered moderate to severe turbulence...."" According to the American Eagle Safety/Flight Service Trip Report (FSTR) which is an attachment to this report, ""[flight attendant] Alvarez was finishing her beverage service and they hit turbulence. She flew into the air twice and cart came down on her right leg. She was on her way to the galley to stow cart."" The captain also reported that the autopilot which was on at the time, did not disengage. A passenger who is an emergency medical technician (EMT), attended to the passenger and was assisted initially by the first officer. A medical emergency was declared and the flight continued to the destination airport and landed uneventfully. The first report to ATC occurred at 1448 local, when, while approaching the JUNUR intersection, a flightcrew member declared a medical emergency and advised the controller that the flight had encountered turbulence 50 miles back.

Probable Cause: The in-flight encounter with moderate to severe turbulence in clouds resulting in the serious injury to the flight attendant. A contributing factor in the accident was the poor in-flight planning by the captain for his allowing beverage service to continue after being advised by ATC of an area of turbulence that was approximately 4 minutes ahead of their position.

The airplane returned to Cartagena for an emergency landing. An initial examination of the No. 2 engineÂ’s propeller assembly revealed one of the six blades had separated through the metal base just outboard of the propeller hub. An adjacent blade was fractured through the composite airfoil at about the midspan area. The examination of the engine revealed that both of the forward engine mounts had broken, and the engine sagged to the bottom of the engine cowling.

Both crew members were killed.
TOTAL Linhas AÃ©reas Flight 5561, departed SÃ£o Paulo-Guarulhos (GRU) at 04:52 on a domestic flight to Londrina Airport, PR (LDB). The ATR climbed to FL180 and the flight progressed uneventful until 05:37. At that time the autopilot disconnected. The crew faced an elevator pitch trim runaway. There was no emergency checklist available for this situation. Also, the pilots rarely received training for an event like this. The captain instructed the copilot to pull a specific circuit breaker. The copilot initially did not understand this instructions but later complied. Two seconds later the Vmo (maximum operating speed) alarm sounded and engine power was reduced to 10%.
The crew attempted to re-establish level flight but failed. The airplane descended out of control and struck the ground at a speed of 366 knots.

The ATR-42 departed SÃ£o Paulo at 04:40 in the morning for a mail flight to Londrina and climbed to its cruising altitude of FL180. Twenty minutes later the
airplane crashed in a field near Paranapanema.

PROBABLE CAUSE:
1. Human Factors
Psychological aspect - Contributing factor
The pilots' perception about the situation was affected by lack of specific training and procedures, which, coupled with the limited time available for action and lack of clarity in communications, influenced the time elapsed for taking corrective actions.
Operational Aspect
a) Coordination Cabin - Contributed
Communication between the crew was not clear at the time of emergency, making the co-pilot did not understand at first, the action to be performed, which increased the time spent to disarm the CB. Such facts, however, can not be separated from the situation experienced by pilots with inadequate training for emergency and in a short time to identify the problem and take the corrective actions.
b) Supervision - Undetermined
The company had not provided a regular CRM training to pilots. Furthermore, the captain did not receive simulator training for over one year. It was impossible to determine, however, if the regular training and updating of the CRM simulator training of the pilot would have prevented the accident.
c) Other Operational Issues - Undetermined
The removal of the pilot from his seat at the time of the emergency may have increased the time spent in identifying the crash and taking corrective actions, but it was not possible to establish whether the accident would be avoided if he would have been in the cockpit.
The co-pilot was slow to understand the situation and initiate corrective actions, although the alarm ""whooler"" has sounded, also increasing the elapsed time.

2. Material Factor
a) Project - Contributed
The operational testing under J IC 27-32-00 allowed the partial completion of the procedures due to lack of clarity, which allowed the release of the aircraft for flight with a defective relay.
Furthermore, although the elevator trim system has been certified, no procedure for emergency triggering of the compensator in the manuals provided by the manufacturer, no replacement intervals of the components of the elevator trim system in ""Time Limits"" systems normal and reserves were not independent and the system had a low tolerance for errors.

Turbulence associated with a frontal passage had been forecast en-route but another aircraft flying the same route in the opposite direction reported that no turbulence had been encountered. Whilst in cloud and approximately 50 nm from Dublin the aircraft encountered light turbulence at which point the commander switched on the cabin seat belt signs. The cabin crew member immediately secured the cabin and informed the commander by inter-phone that this had been done. Because the turbulence was only very light she remained standing in the galley, but a few seconds later the aircraft encountered severe turbulence which lasted between 10 and 20 seconds. This was sufficient to throw the cabin crewmember across the galley, causing her to hit the cabin ceiling and a bulkhead before finally throwing her to the floor.
The turbulence stopped and after recovering for a short while the crew member managed to get into her seat and secure the harness, although she found moving and breathing both difficult and painful.
Realising what had happened a passenger asked if she was all right, however she was too shocked and winded to reply. After a further short period she was able to speak to the commander on the inter-phone and inform him of the situation. She was further able to make a pre-landing announcement to passengers to ensure the cabin remained secure, although she was unable to leave her seat. Being aware of the situation the commander requested that an ambulance meet the aircraft. On arrival at Dublin airport he asked the passengers to remain seated so that the First Officer could make his way into the cabin to open the cabin door and attend to the injured crew-member. She was then taken to hospital where an examination showed that she had suffered skeletal muscular injuries.

There were no injuries among the 22 passengers and three crew members.
Danish Air Transport flight DTR54 was on a scheduled flight from Bergen to FlorÃ¸ (FRO). During takeoff the pilots experienced considerable control problems related to the elevator function. They declared an emergency situation and returned for landing. The landing was accomplished without further incident 7 minutes after takeoff.
After landing it was found that the control problems were caused by the right elevator hanging below the horizontal stabiliser, attached only by the inboard of the three hinges that normally connect the elevator to the stabiliser. A bolt was missing from both the centre and outer hinges. Both of the bolts and one of the nuts that normally should connect the hinge assemblies together were found. One of the bolts was found on the runway, the other inside the elevator.
Investigation indicates that the bolt belonging to the outer hinge assembly fell out during the takeoff in question, while the bolt in the centre hinge assembly had fallen out at an earlier point in time, without being discovered. The report concludes that the self-locking nuts cannot have been tightened with the required torque when the elevator was fitted. This error was most probably introduced after the aircraft was repainted in 1999.

Significant investigation results:
The control problems experienced by the crew during take-off and the rest of the flight began when the outboard of the three hinge bolts that attach the right elevator to the stabiliser loosened and fell out. As the centre bolt had fallen out at an earlier point in time without being discovered, the elevator was hanging in place only attached by the inboard hinge.
The self-locking nuts that should hold the centre and outboard hinge bolts in place cannot have been tightened with the required torque.

The radar and several electrical systems were knocked off-line by the strike. Most of the systems were restored, and the airplane landed without incident. The pilot reported that after takeoff, they deviated around a thunderstorm, and that there were numerous thunderstorms in the area. The pilot said after clearing the thunderstorm, they were flying in clear air. He said along the route, most of the observed thunderstorms were behind them, and that they entered instrument meteorological conditions in a large area of cloud cover. As they started a normal descent for the destination airport in smooth air, he indicated that he and the first officer simultaneously noticed that the radio magnetic indicator needles ""spun around in different directions,"" and that an ""instant later"" they were struck by lightning. He did not indicate what was observed on the radar screen. The pilot did not report any mechanical anomalies prior to the lightning strike. Portions of the left aileron's lightning strike protection were de-bonded by the strike, and the aileron was replaced.


Probable Cause: A lightning strike during a normal descent for landing, which resulted in structural damage to the airplane's left aileron.

On the final turn of a night visual approach to runway 34 at Lyon Bron Airport, the crew momentarily lost sight of the runway. The aircraft was on short final at high speed, well above the glide slope. During the flare, while the aircraft was still in the air, the engines were brought to ground idle. The aircraft landed hard and then taxied to the apron.
The main landing gear shock absorbers were broken.

Causes of the accident
The accident was caused by :
- an unstabilised approach that continued until landing ;
- inadvertent use of the IDLE GATE pull tab.
The following factors contributed to the accident
- the improvisation of a manoeuvre different from what had been envisaged in the arrival briefing ;
- the difficulties involved in carrying out night visual approaches.

A cold front had passed over the coast and was on its way east, and local moderate icing was forecast.
While climbing, when passing flight level FL100 (approx. 10,000 ft), ice began to form on the aircraft. The aircraft's de-icing systems were switched on and functioned normally. Nevertheless, more ice built up and, when passing through FL120, there was a marked reduction in the aircraft's climb ability. At FL140 the autopilot disconnected, at much the same time as the aircraft entered an uncommanded roll to approx. 45 degrees to the right and began to lose height. When the crew believed they had regained control, the aircraft suddenly rolled uncommanded to the left in a similar manner. Around one and a half minutes after the first uncommanded roll movement, the climb was stable once more. The flight continued to Gardermoen without any further problems. The loss of altitude in the incident was approx. 1500 ft, and was
not critical in relation to terrain height. No personal injuries or material damage occurred.
In addition to establishing how and why the control of the aircraft was temporarily lost, the AIBN has uncovered several latent contributing factors and safety problems in this investigation. These safety problems can roughly be subdivided into four groups:
- Operation of this aircraft type in icing conditions
- Serious deficiencies in the company's quality system and flight safety programme
- Insufficient follow-up and rule enforcement on the part of the CAA-N after it had disclosed serious deficiencies in the quality system and flight safety programme in its flight operations inspections of the company over several years prior to the incident.
- The company was assigned two new tendered routes despite the deficiencies in its safety management persisting.

In the opinion of the AIBN, this case illustrates the importance well functioning safety regulation has on aviation safety. The failure of the CAA-N follow-up contributed to deficiencies in the Coast
Air quality system and flight safety programme not being corrected in time.

CONTRIBUTING FACTORS (translated from Portuguese report)
Operational Aspect
a. Weather conditions - Contributed
A light rain caused the presence of water on the runway, enabling the occurrence of hydroplaning.
b. Infrastructure - Contributed
The accumulation of water on the surface of the runway, as a result of inadequate drainage, lack of ""grooving"", enabled the hydroplaning.
c. Education - Contributed
The pilot applied full pressure on the right pedal, generating a force to the left that contributed to the departure off the runway.
During hydroplaning, the pilot should not apply pedal to the opposite side to which the aircraft slides; this fact was not covered during the instruction of the pilot.
d. Application of command - Contributed
In the face of hydroplaning, the pilot applied the right pedal, aggravating the departure of the aircraft to the left.

The incident occurred when the aircraft was taking off on a return flight from Bergen to FlorÃ¸. The crew observed that snow was forming on the aircraft during the stopover at Flesland, in addition to remnants of clear ice from the previous flight on the wings, the horizontal tail surface and the propeller spinners. Prior to departure, the aircraft was de-iced and treated with anti-icing fluid.
At 1606 hrs, OY-JRY started its take-off roll at Flesland. In his report, the commander has stated that 15Â° flaps were applied. Mass and centre of gravity was within limitations. 10 kt before achieving rotation speed, the aircraft took off without any input being applied to the controls. The aircraft then continued in a shallow climb at low speed.
According to the commander, the aircraft continued the uncontrolled ascent in spite of both control columns being moved to the full forward position (stop) and engine power being increased. The stick shaker activated and the â€œcricket soundâ€ was heard for a few seconds while the airspeed decreased. Eventually, the nose of the aircraft started to come down and speed gradually increased, at which point the stick shaker ceased. While the speed increased, the crew experienced that the control columns oscillated back and forth and were heavy to operate.
The crew report states that they started on a visual turn to return to Flesland, but abandoned this when the aircraft entered clouds. The climb was then stabilizing, and the controls became gradually easier to move. When the aircraft emerged above the clouds, the crew continued to the destination without using autopilot. The flight controls were inspected after landing at FlorÃ¸ without anything abnormal being found.

21 Feb 2008,ATR 42-300,YV1449,Santa Bárbara Airlines,46,ca 10 km NW of Mérida-A Carnevalli Airport (MRD),w/o,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/321766,ATR 42 (all series),_AT42,17:05,028,P&W Canada PW120,Fatalities: 46 / Occupants: 46,0,Accident,En route,Passenger - Scheduled,MÃ©rida-A Carnevalli Airport (MRD/SVMD),Caracas-SimÃ³n BolÃ­var International Airport (CCS/SVMI),"An ATR-42-300 operating Santa BÃ¡rbara Airlines Flight 518 was destroyed when it impacted the side of a mountain shortly after takeoff from MÃ©rida-A Carnevalli Airport in Venezuela. All 46 on board were killed.
MÃ©rida Airport is located in a mountain valley at an elevation of 5010 feet. Terrain in the valley rises from 1000 to 19.500 feet. Arrivals and departures have to use the Rio Chama corridor to the west of the airport. Runway 07 is used for landings and takeoffs have to be performed in the opposite direction, from runway 25.
Santa BÃ¡rbara Airlines however used an unpublished approach and departure procedure which let the aircraft use a valley to the northeast of the airport. This procedure saved about 15 minutes of flying time on the route to Caracas.
After all passengers had boarded for flight 518 to Caracas, it took about 30 minutes for the pilots to arrive at the aircraft. Being late, they immediately started the engines while simultaneously asking for permission to do so.
Because an Avior Airlines flight was approaching the airport, the crew were told to expedite their departure or wait for the arrival of the Avior aircraft. The flight crew decided to go and began taxiing 2 minutes and 40 seconds after startup. Consequently the AHRS (attitude and heading reference) system of the airplane was unusable. The aircraft needed to remain still for 3 minutes after the battery is turned on so that all gyroscopes, accelerometers and magnetometers can be stabilized and synchronized.
The AHRS provides attitude information for aircraft, including roll, pitch and yaw. The captain possibly expected to re-initialize the system while they were at cruising altitude.
After departure from runway 25 the crew planned to use the unpublished procedure. Climbing through clouds a 180-degree turn was initiated. Using the unreliable magnetic compass, the flight made a 270 degree turn, heading towards rising terrain. The captain took over control from the copilot. When visual contact with terrain was regained, the crew noted they were heading for mountains. The captain tried to avoid rising terrain but the aircraft impacted the side of a mountain at 3810 m.

CONCLUSIONS
The attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) as a device was operational, however the initialization of the system was incomplete, so the standard mode was in a fault condition. This failure mode left the RMI or radio magnetic indicators and the autopilot inoperative.
The EGPWS or enhanced ground proximity warning system was inoperative in the ""enhanced"" functions, since the information is displayed on the EFIS system screens, therefore there was no early warning (Visual) of impact against the mountain range.
The GPS was the only instrument capable of providing heading information to within one degree of accuracy. Because it is located on the co-pilot's lower left panel, the information provided by the co-pilot was basically available for co-pilot observation. In addition, the size of the display is relatively small for the information it shows.
The crew was valid, qualified and certified by the National Institute of Civil Aeronautics (INAC). However, the crew was very unconcerned to learn that they were taking off with the AHRS system inoperative and the weather conditions were instrument or IMC.
The meteorological station in Merida was inoperative.
The control tower did not have an operational communications recording system.
According to the deformation shown on the low pressure compressor wheels, the engines had power at the time of impact.

Weather at Lubbock was poor with an overcast at 500 feet, freezing drizzle and mist.
The aircraft encountered icing conditions while en route to Lubbock. And although the airplane accumulated some ice during the flight that degraded its performance, the NTSB determined that the aircraft could have landed safely had the airspeed been maintained.
During the approach to Lubbock runway 17R, at about 1400 feet above the ground and about 90 seconds from the runway, the captain indicated a flight control problem saying, ""We have no flaps."" Although the crewmembers had been trained to perform a go-around and refer to a checklist if a flap problem occurred during an approach, the captain chose to continue the approach as he attempted to troubleshoot the flap anomaly while the first officer flew the plane. Neither flight crewmember adequately monitored the airspeed, which decayed to the extent that the stick shaker activated, which warned of an impending aerodynamic stall.
The captain continued the unstabilized approach even though he received additional stick shaker activations and an aural ""pull up"" warning from the terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS). At that point, the plane was descending at a rate of over 2,000 ft per minute.
Although procedures for responding to either the stick shaker or the TAWS warning require the immediate application of maximum engine power, the captain did not apply maximum power until 17 seconds after the TAWS warning. Seconds after maximum power was applied, the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall and crashed.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crew's failure to monitor and maintain a minimum safe airspeed while executing an instrument approach in icing conditions, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall at low altitude. Contributing to the accident were 1) the flight crew's failure to follow published standard operating procedures in response to a flap anomaly, 2) the captain's decision to continue with the unstabilized approach, 3) the flight crew's poor crew resource management, and 4) fatigue due to the time of day in which the accident occurred and a cumulative sleep debt, which likely impaired the captain's performance.""

The crew spotted the vehicle conducting the inspection on runway 20R and, once authorized, made the landing on runway 20L. There was valid information (NOTAM) regarding the interdiction of runway 20L.
After landing, the crew spotted the runway closed sign.

Contributing factors:

Concerning the operation of the aircraft
a) Cabin coordination - contributed
To the extent that the crew failed to consider the information received at the beginning of the flight stage (NOTAM) that should have been clearly and recalled during the phases of the flight, especially in the descent briefing. In addition to compliance with the ATIS message that was available.
b) Pilot forgetfulness - undetermined
It is possible that the crew forgot the information available and consulted before the flight.
c) Airport infrastructure - undetermined
It is probable that the type of horizontal signage used to inform of the runway closure was not effective for the wet conditions over the aerodrome and did not allow it to be displayed early enough to avoid landing.

All six crew members and 46 passengers survived the accident.
The domestic passenger flight TGN162 departed Tanjung Redep/Berau-Kalimaru Airport (BEJ) at 10:30 and climbed to Flight Level (FL) 140. Balikpapan approach cleared the crew direct to Samarinda Airport (SRI). The enroute part of the flight was uneventful. On approach to Samarinda, the crew was cleared to track direct to left downwind for runway 04. The controller informed them that the wind was 060 degrees at 12 knots. During the final approach for runway 04, the left ECU (Engine Control Unit) light illuminated followed by low oil pressure and torque indications. The captain decided to go around and divert to Balikpapan-Sepingan Airport (BPN) which was 92 km (50 NM) to the South. The flight crew carried out the engine shut-down procedure and commenced a climb to 4000 ft with the left engine inoperative. Approximately 16 Nm from Balikpapan Airport, while climbing through 3,800 feet, the right ECU light illuminated, immediately followed by low oil pressure and low torque indications. The right engine then failed. The crew broadcast a MAYDAY to Balikpapan Approach and decided to conduct a forced landing into a clear field in the Samboja area, about 16 Nm from the Balikpapan Airport.

CAUSES: ""The both engine were lack of fuel before flame out, it was indicated the fuel management was out of control during flight that might be a misleading of fuel quantity indication. The proper analysis could not be carried out due to both

Despite this, the aircraft was repeatedly released for service under the MEL without proper analysis or rectification. Refueling was required to be done manually with fuel quantity checks using dipsticks, but the responsible engineer did not supervise the process and delegated it to the first officer. Refueling was incorrectly carried out in automatic mode, and due to the failed indicator, fuel was not loaded into the right tank. As a result, only 229 kg of fuel was present in the right tank before departure, although the total fuel load appeared sufficient for the planned route.

After 47 minutes of flight, the right engine shut down due to fuel exhaustion. The crew did not take immediate corrective actions, and while discussing warnings they failed to monitor flight parameters. Airspeed decreased significantly, angle of attack increased, and the aircraft stalled, losing about 480 meters of altitude. Recovery actions were delayed. The crew then continued flight with one engine, unsuccessfully attempted multiple restarts, depleted the battery, and made inappropriate fuel system manipulations that nearly caused loss of the remaining engine.

The investigation concluded that the serious incident resulted from poor maintenance practices, inadequate preflight preparation and fueling oversight, insufficient crew training for single-engine operations, and weak crew coordination. These factors led to fuel starvation, engine shutdown, loss of airspeed control, stall, and unsafe handling during continued flight."

When the AOA reached 11.5Â°, the autopilot disengaged, the ailerons immediately deflected to about 12,5Â° and the aircraft rolled to the left to an 80Â° maximum bank angle. The maximum aileron deflection was recorded at 12.5Â°.
Recovery was achieved by a prompt reaction of the crew, which applied maximum power and brought the wings back to a level position by quickly positioning the ailerons opposite to the initial roll upset. The loss of altitude was 600 feet.

On April 7, 1989, the FAA issued AD 89-09-05, which prohibited the use of the autopilot in icing conditions. The FAA determined during its investigation that the autopilot masked an asymmetric ice buildup, and the airplane rolled when the autopilot disconnected. This AD was later superseded by a new AD which removed the autopilot restriction following the installation of vortex generators to improve roll control of the airplane.

NTSB Probable Cause: ""Stall induced by the accretion of moderate to severe clear icing.""

Both aircraft were operating in accordance with instrument flight rules and were being provided with radar vectors for their respective approaches. The aircraft, while on their assigned headings, conflicted one mile southeast of the final approach path of runway 24 Left.

The Transportation Safety Board of Canada determined that the cause of the risk of collision was the untimely takeover of communications at the arrival position by the instructor and the untimely opening of the low-arrival position to relieve the arrival position of excess workload. The absence of procedures, general guidelines, and supervisor training concerning the opening/closing of control positions and the management of control staff likely contributed to this occurrence."

THE CAPTAIN STATED THAT HE OBSERVED ABOUT 3 INCHES OF ICE ON TOP OF THE WING, BEHIND THE LEADING EDGE WING BOOT. APPROVED PROCEDURES FOR FLIGHT IN ICING CONDITIONS REQUIRE THE PROPELLER SPEED BE MAINTAINED AT 86 PERCENT OR HIGHER TO PREVENT UNEVEN ICE ACCUMULATION OF THE WING. THE DFDR INFORMATION REVEALED THE CREW HAD THE PROPELLER SPEED AT 77 PERCENT, 9 PERCENT THE REQUIRED MINIMUM.

Probable Cause: THE FLIGHTCREW'S FAILURE TO FOLLOW APPROVED PROCEDURES THAT REQUIRED A MINIMUM PROPELLER SPPED WHILE FLYING IN ICING CONDITION. CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSS OF ROLL CONTROL WERE THE ENCOUNTERS WITH SEVERE TURBULENCE AND ICING CONDITIONS.

The B747 received minor damage and the ATR-42 received substantial damage. There were no injuries.

The crew of the departing ATR 42, N242AT, had accepted an intersection departure, and was holding on a stub taxiway when the following 747, HZ-AIS, tried to get around it. The left wing of the 747 contacted the vertical stabilizer and rudder of the ATR 42. At the time of the accident, the captain of the 747 was making an announcement on the public address system to the cabin, and at the same time attempting to maneuver the airplane to the right to avoid the ATR 42.

Probable Cause: misjudged clearance by the captain of the B747, HZ-AIS, as he attempted to maneuver around the ATR-42, N242AT. A factor related to the accident was the diverted attention of the captain of the B-747.

11 Feb 1994,ATR 42-300,G-BUEB,CityFlyer Express,0,London-Gatwick Airport (LGW),sub,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/325044,ATR 42-300,AT43,15:07,304,Pratt & Whitney Canada PW120,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 41,0,Accident,Taxi,Passenger - Scheduled,Dublin Airport (DUB/EIDW),London-Gatwick Airport (LGW/EGKK),"An ATR 42-300 impacted a ground power unit at the parking spot at London-Gatwick Airport, U.K.
The aircraft operated on a flight from Dublin with the a new captain undergoing his first session of line training after a simulator conversion programme. He was Pilot Not Flying (PNF) on this leg. The Pilot Flying (PF) was a senior Training Captain. The taxiing of the aircraft however was accomplished by the PNF in the left seat as the nosewheel steering system hand wheel was on the left side of the flight deck. During the taxi out for departure from Dublin, the take-off configuration test was carried out and it was noted that the No 2 DC generator had failed. The crew stopped the aircraft on the taxiway and attempted to reset the generator. They also checked the aircraft's Minimum Equipment List (MEL) in order to ascertain whether it was acceptable to operate the aircraft with one DC generator off-line. In the event, the generator was restored, and the aircraft took off at 13:47 hrs. Shortly after departure, the No 2 DC generator again failed. The appropriate checklist was carried out for the DC Gen 2 Fault, which simply involved the switching off of the affected generator. There were no other actions required in the checklist. Apart from crew consideration of possible expeditious en route diversion airfields in the event of a second generator failure, the flight to Gatwick was uneventful, and the aircraft landed on runway 08R at 15:02.
The aircraft vacated the runway on No 2 rapid exit turnoff and was cleared to taxi to Stand 3 routing via the Alpha Exit link. The company's normal operating checklist, and that of the manufacturer, called for the No 1 engine to be shut down as part of the after landing drills, once a one minute cooling period had been observed. Nothing in the abnormal checklist for a DC Gen Fault contradicted this procedure. When the left engine is feathered during taxi on this type of aircraft, there is a tendency for the aircraft to initially swing to the right. The left seat pilot therefore suggested that the feathering action be taken as the aircraft approached the natural right turn after passing through the Alpha Exit.
This was accomplished, and the left propeller was feathered. In order to enable the engineers to carry out an accurate engine oil contents check during the turnaround, the left engine was kept running with the propeller feathered. The usual procedure prior to this check requires a further period of 20 seconds before engine shutdown. In the event, a period of 35 seconds elapsed prior to engine shutdown. The apron surface was damp. The toe brakes were checked for effectiveness by the left seat pilot, prior to turning onto the stand centreline of Stand 3, and he proceeded under marshalling guidance towards the appropriate stop position. On receiving the stop signal from the ground crew, the left seat pilot applied the toe brakes, but these were ineffective. He notified the other pilot of the problem, and proceeded to apply reverse thrust to the right engine. The commander also applied his toe brakes, to no effect. The PF then reached across and pulled the emergency/parking brake handle, located on the left side of the power lever quadrant, but this action, along with the initiation of reverse thrust, occurred too late to prevent the right propeller from striking the ground power unit (GPU) which had been pre-positioned to the front right side of the normal parking position in order to allow expeditious connection to the aircraft's ground power socket. The collision occurred some 30 seconds after the shutdown of the left engine.
The two ground crew, who were in position to meet the aircraft, observed that a collision was imminent and began to run clear of the area. Debris from the impact struck one of the crew men and narrowly missed the other. Fortunately, neither sustained injuries from the debris.

The co-pilot was flying the aircraft. The ATR 42 was cleared to climb to flight level 210 and proceed on airway V372 to the Mirabel VOR. Shortly after take-off, the crew engaged the autopilot (A/P) at 3000 feet above sea level (asl).
The climb was routine up to about 17000 feet asl, when a violent explosion rocked the aircraft and the cabin depressurized. The CONTINUOUS REPETITIVE CHIME warning sounded in the cockpit, and at the same time the master warning light and cabin excessive altitude light illuminated. The crew observed that the right engine parameters indicated a total loss of power.
Nine seconds after the depressurization, the pilot-in-command assumed control of the aircraft and disengaged the A/P. He aborted the climb, commenced a descent, and maintained speed. The engine failure procedure and single engine checklist were completed during the descent. The co-pilot contacted Montreal Area Control Centre (ACC) and advised the controller that the aircraft had experienced an engine failure and requested clearance to descend to 15,000 feet, then to 11,000 feet.
The co-pilot pulled fire handle No. 2 after visually confirming the damage to the engine and observing a fuel leak. The cabin excessive altitude checklist was then completed. Three minutes after the occurrence, the crew declared an emergency with the Montreal ACC.
About seven minutes after the cabin depressurization, the co-pilot visually confirmed the structural damage in the cabin. The pilot-in-command felt it was preferable to minimize the number of turns in order to reduce the risk of further structural damage. After noting the damage and assessing the situation, the pilot-in-command decided to continue the flight to Dorval. At that time, the aircraft was 36 minutes flying time from Val D'Or, 39 minutes from Mirabel and 44 minutes from Dorval.
At 10:28, the aircraft initiated a descent toward 9000 feet asl and maintained that altitude, which was above the cloud layer, until it entered the Montreal terminal zone. The aircraft was aligned with the ILS for Dorval runway 06L by radar vectors. It landed without further incident at 11:16.

An investigation showed that the top of the No. 2 blade had failed and punctured the fuselage as the blade passed on its trajectory toward and beneath the aircraft. A vertical cut measuring 104 cm by 2.5 cm was observed between stations 9157 and 9333 on the right side of the fuselage. The seat adjacent to the vertical cut was partially cut. Two landing gear hydraulic lines mounted under the floor were slightly bent.

Causes: ""Corrosion pitting had occurred on the surface of the taper bore of the No. 2 blade as a result of water combining with chlorine deposits on the cork in the taper bore. The chlorine was associated with the bleaching of the corks during their manufacture. One of the corrosion pits was the point of origin of the fatigue cracks that caused the propeller blade to fracture.""

The crew performed a visual approach. As the nose wheel touched the runway surface and reverse thrust was selected, the crew felt that the aircraft trajectory was deviating to the right. At a distance of approximately 550 meters from threshold 07, the aircraft veered off the runway to the right side with a constant trajectory and stopped 200 meters from the end of the runway at 90 meters laterally. The nose landing gear collapsed during the runway excursion. The emergency evacuation was through the front exits. Eight passengers were slightly injured or shocked. The right main landing gear and the nose landing gear were damaged.

The probable cause of this accident is the landing performed with a NP selected at 77% on both propellers instead 100% as required by the 'before landing' checklist. With NP selected at 77%, a temporary mismatch in blade angle due to the tolerance condition of the PCU, can quickly lead to a propeller thrust asymmetry of about 1400 daN and to the veering to the right of the aircraft. The use of the nose wheel steering instead of the rudder and the poor cockpit crew co-operation during the final approach were factors contributing to the accident.

The captain briefed the flight attendant on the expected turbulence for the entire flight and kept the seatbelt sign illuminated continuously. Turbulence was encountered for the majority of the flight. Radar vectors were provided for an LDA Runway 26L approach to Honolulu. Also, a descent was made to 7,000 feet with the aircraft heading toward the only clear area between cells shown on both the aircraft and approach control radars. No turbulence had been encountered for several minutes, and the flight attendant elected to do a passenger/seat belt compliance check. The captain said three strong 'jolts' were encountered, accompanied by altitude excursions. The turbulence was encountered as the attendant was returning to her seat in the rear of the aircraft. The flight attendant was bounced off the ceiling twice and sustained a displaced fracture of her left ankle.

Probable Cause: the flight attendant's decision to leave her seat in an area of forecast and known moderate turbulence. The turbulence was a related factor.

Examination of the landing gear revealed that the barrel lugs (used to attach the swinging lever to the main landing gear barrel) had failed. The fracture of the outboard lower lug exhibited clam shell marks typical of a fatigue crack. The fatigue crack emanated from a corrosion pit in the bore of the lug. The four bushings for the lower lugs of the barrel (replaced during overhaul) did not have the proper interference fit. The bushings did not have the proper applications of corrosion preventative applied to the surface of the bushings. Primer paint had not been applied during overhaul, and Mastinox was used instead of the wet primer that the manufacturer's procedures specified. During the course of the investigation, nine landing gears (with various numbers of total cycles since overhaul or manufacture) were inspected. The inspections revealed torn or missing rubber sealant used on bushing flanges, corrosion in the lug bores, and corrosion on the lug faces.

Probable Cause: improper use of procedures by maintenance personnel at an overhaul facility during overhaul of the landing gear, allowing corrosion to occur on the barrel lugs of the landing gear, which subsequently led to fatigue cracking of the lugs and eventual collapse of the gear.

reports that he became concerned while taxiing because the commander at one point brought the left
wing of the aircraft close to a hangar. However, when this was queried the commander replied that
everything was all right. Approaching a bend in the taxiway, the first officer was again concerned
with the closeness of the aircraft to the grass verge and he brought this also to the commander's
attention. The commander recollects the first officer pointing out the proximity of the verge and
other obstacles but nonetheless he continued to turn the aircraft until he was advised by ATC that he
had run over a lamp at the edge of the taxiway and that one of the tires had deflated. After the
passengers had disembarked, the first officer and flight attendant observed an apparent drowsiness
and lack of coordination on the part of the commander and arranged for medical attention.
Subsequent medical diagnosis of the commander revealed a condition which was likely to have
caused his distraction at the time of the incident.

The captain stated that after turning south on NK, he taxied the airplane towards the IAB terminal, and saw what appeared to be a hard surface ramp to the left and right of the airplane and he proceeded to make a left turn believing that he was now taxiing on the IAB ramp. The captain reported that the airport diagram on the Jeppesen charts showed the intersection of NK and the IAB ramp to be a 'T' or 90 degree turn, but in reality, the intersection is constructed at a 45 degree angle to the left of taxiway NK which joins the IAB ramp. The pilot further stated that no lights were available to outline the edge of the ramp area. He added that he continued to taxi in an east direction, believing that he was on the IAB ramp. According to the airport's operations personnel, the taxiway is properly marked with a solid center line and the area is bordered by a double yellow line delineating the edge of the taxiway. Additionally, at the time of the accident, recessed taxiway lights were in place to further delineate the edge of the taxiway.

Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to follow the proper taxi route while taxiing back to the terminal. A factor was the glare radiating from the airport's terminal area.

When the flighcrew attempted to reset the No. 1 generator, the No. 2 generator also failed. Attempts to reset either of the generators were unsuccessful and after about 1 minute the main battery failed. The flightcrew switched to the emergency battery and made a precautionary landing. Postlanding examination showed the No. 1 generator had failed due to failure of the field excitation wire lug which was caused by improper installation of the wire. The aircraft was on the second flight since the No. 1 generator was changed. The No. 2 generator operated normally in postlanding tests. The main battery was found to be discharged. The battery was returned to service after charging. After the incident the aircraft continued to discharge the main battery and the engine start switch was found defective causing the main battery to discharge.

Probable Cause: The failure of the No. 1 generator field excitation return wire terminal lug due to improper installation of the field excitation return wire by maintenance personnel; the subsequent failure of the No. 2 generator due to overvoltage, caused by the momentary closure of the No. 1 generator contactor, as a result of the flight crew's attempt to reset the No. 1 generator, while an overvoltage condition existed at its POR, due to the shorted failure of the No. 1 GCU diode CR17; and the rapid failure of the aircraft's main battery, accelerated by its existing depleted condition, following an extended period of inadequate charging, due to a damaged electrical system.

The ground handler disconnected the electrical cable, closed the airplane's ground service access door, wound the cable and stored it on its GPU mounted rack. She then proceeded directly to the right side nose area, made eye contact with the first officer, and bent down to pull the nose wheel chocks. When she pulled the forward chock, the right nose tire passed over her foot, and the aircraft rolled forward. Observing the mishap, the second ground handler ran over to pick her off the ground and they both ran forward trying to give the flight crew the emergency stop signal. The airplane continued forward about 10 to 15 feet until collision by the No. 2 propeller with the top of the GPU. The propeller was in high rpm at the time of the propeller strike. Fragments of propeller blade impacted the right side fuselage and the sudden stoppage fractured the No. 2 engine case, causing a fuel leak. A fire was ignited by flame droplets falling from the No. 2 engine intake to puddled up jet fuel under the engine and main landing gear area developed. One of the four propeller blades separated from its hub and all four blades sustained tip damage. The spinner was torn as a result of the blade separation. The propeller collision caused metal and composite fragments to impact and dent the right side fuselage. Although the aircraft is still on the US Register, the plane was reported withdrawn from use and used for spares.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's failure to verify that the parking brake was applied prior to engine start, and the resultant inadvertent movement of the aircraft and collision with the ground power cart once No. 2 was started.""

Night instrument meteorological conditions with a visibility of 1/2 sm in snow and freezing fog prevailed at the time of the accident. Flight 4047 was cleared for the ILS 28 approach and began its descent at a point 1.6 nm inbound from the outer marker. While on the final approach segment, the airplane reached a descent rate of 2,000 fpm and the alerts defining the outer and inner envelopes of the ground proximity warning system sounded. During the descent, the airplane's indicated airspeed varied from 160 knots to 122.8 knots. The flight crew briefed an icing approach speed of 123 knots with the first officer acting as the flying pilot. Fifty-six seconds prior to touchdown, air traffic control (ATC) issued winds 070 degrees at 17 knots with a runway 28 Mu of 82,85,81 and chemically treated thin loose snow over patchy ice. The tailwind component was 14.722 knots. The first officer transferred the flight controls to the captain at approximately 400-500 feet agl. Two seconds prior to touchdown, ATC issued winds 060 degrees at 20 knots. The tailwind component was 15.320 knots. The southern runway lights extending from 2,574 feet - 3,311 feet down the runway were damaged. Flight data recorder information indicated that flight 4047 touched down in a 7 degree left bank attitude. American Eagle had in place 'stabilized approach criteria' to define conditions which required a mandatory missed approach. The American Eagle Aircraft Operating Manual stated that the limiting tailwind component for the airplane was 10 knots. Following the accident, an AE crew chief stated that the #1 MLG tire was peeled off the rim and 'ripped up bad.' He described the #2 MLG tire as having side ways scuff marks on the treaded portion of the tire. He stated that he performed an A/S test and if it was bad that he would have entered it into the minimum equipment list. The aircraft received a ferry permit, after the accident, to be flown to Marquette for repair. The ferry captain reported that he flew the aircraft from TVC to Marquette. Prior to leaving the gate, he tested the antiskid (A/S) system and one of the fault lights came on momentarily in which the captain described the duration as 'just a blink'. The Captain then executed a high speed taxi, braked and then stopped the aircraft. He then tested the A/S light, and no light illuminated. He also reported that there were no problems en route or upon landing at Marquette. He added that there was no fault light illumination during or after landing at Marquette.

Probable Cause: The crew's failure to execute a missed approach and the flying pilot's (captain) failure to maintain directional control upon touchdown with a seven degree left bank and a right quartering tailwind. Factor's were the snow covered runway/landing area and the night conditions.

The plane was at an altitude of 1400 meters and turning left with a 30deg bank when it was crashed into a hill (30% slope), 15 meters below the summit.
The weather conditions with Pristina were 5 000 meters horizontal visibility, a sky covered with 700 meters and a compact layer of clouds to 920 meters.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The collision of Flight KSV 3275 with high ground was due :
- to teamwork which lacked procedural discipline and vigilance during maneuvers in a mountainous region with poor visibility.
- to the aircraft being kept on its track and then forgotten by a military controller unused to the mountainous environment of the aerodrome and to preventing the risk of collisions with high ground, within the framework of the radar service he was providing.
- to the operator's critical situation as a new company highly dependant on the lease contract, favoring a failure to respect procedures.
- to the opening of the aerodrome to civil traffic without an advance evaluation of the operating conditions or of the conditions for distribution of aeronautical information.

The following factors contributed to the accident :
- crew fatigue, favoring a lowering of vigilance.
- undertaking the flight with an unserviceable or disconnected GPWS.

Following take-off from Runway 23 at Teesside at 0719 hrs, the cruising altitude of 19,000 feet was reached around 20 minutes later, with all flight deck indications remaining normal. At this point the flight deck crew was informed by the cabin crew member that a passenger had reported a panel missing from the No 1 engine. The cabin crew member also noted that she had heard a noise during take-off, which she had attributed to movement of baggage in the aft compartment.
The flight deck crew could see from the flight deck that part of the No 1 engine outboard cowl door was broken off and decided to return to Teesside. They informed ATC of a slight technical problem and were radar vectored back to the airport, limiting the airspeed to 180 kt to minimise the possibility of additional damage. The crew declined to declare an emergency but ATC placed the airport emergency services at local standby. During final approach the crew spotted a panel on Runway 23, near its threshold. The aircraft overflew the panel and landed without further incident.
A cowl door and a number of pieces of smaller debris were found on the runway near to the point at which G-ORFH had started its take-off run. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. No other aircraft had operated from the runway between the time of G-ORFH's take-off and landing.

The accident happened in daylight but in reduced visibility due to fog.
14 Mar 2001,ATR 42-320,OY-JRY,Danish Air Transport,0+1,Lisboa-Humberto Delgado Airport (LIS/LPPT),non,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/497093,ATR 42-300,AT43,,063,P&W Canada PW127,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 2,1,Accident,Standing,Cargo,,Lisboa-Humberto Delgado Airport (LIS/LPPT),"This aircraft was performing a commercial cargo transport flight and had just parked at position ""LL3"" at Lisbon Airport (LPPT). While awaiting connection to the GPUÂ¹, the captain, who had already shut down the left engine during taxiing, kept engine no. 2 running but placed the propeller in feathered position. This allowed the propeller rotation to eventually stop while maintaining the supply of electrical power generated by the engine until the transfer to the GPU could be completed.

A ground handling employee (PORTWAY) placed a chock on the nose wheel and went to retrieve another chock to place on the right main landing gear wheel. When he returned to the aircraft, he approached the main gear by passing between the right engine and the fuselage, without paying attention to the propeller, which was still rotating (by inertia). As he crossed the propeller's rotation plane, he was struck by one of the blades, causing a cranial trauma that threw him to the ground. Although he received prompt medical assistance, he did not survive the injuries and passed away.


Primary Cause
The accident resulted from the execution of a wheel chocking procedure on the right main landing gear of the aircraft while the right engine was running and its propeller was still rotating. The victim chose a dangerous path contrary to the best practices recommended for this procedure, instead of following the safe route advised by safety standards.

Contributing Causes
The following factors are considered contributory to this accident:

1. The fact that the propeller was still rotating and its feathered position did not facilitate its visibility to anyone approaching from the front;
2. The limited importance given to safety factors and standards in the content of the training course provided.Hereâ€™s the English translation:

The flight crew was advised of a heading to fly which led the airplane into a cloud that was not depicted on the weather avoidance radar. ""In this cloud we encountered moderate to severe turbulence...."" According to the American Eagle Safety/Flight Service Trip Report (FSTR) which is an attachment to this report, ""[flight attendant] Alvarez was finishing her beverage service and they hit turbulence. She flew into the air twice and cart came down on her right leg. She was on her way to the galley to stow cart."" The captain also reported that the autopilot which was on at the time, did not disengage. A passenger who is an emergency medical technician (EMT), attended to the passenger and was assisted initially by the first officer. A medical emergency was declared and the flight continued to the destination airport and landed uneventfully. The first report to ATC occurred at 1448 local, when, while approaching the JUNUR intersection, a flightcrew member declared a medical emergency and advised the controller that the flight had encountered turbulence 50 miles back.

Probable Cause: The in-flight encounter with moderate to severe turbulence in clouds resulting in the serious injury to the flight attendant. A contributing factor in the accident was the poor in-flight planning by the captain for his allowing beverage service to continue after being advised by ATC of an area of turbulence that was approximately 4 minutes ahead of their position.

Both crew members were killed.
TOTAL Linhas AÃ©reas Flight 5561, departed SÃ£o Paulo-Guarulhos (GRU) at 04:52 on a domestic flight to Londrina Airport, PR (LDB). The ATR climbed to FL180 and the flight progressed uneventful until 05:37. At that time the autopilot disconnected. The crew faced an elevator pitch trim runaway. There was no emergency checklist available for this situation. Also, the pilots rarely received training for an event like this. The captain instructed the copilot to pull a specific circuit breaker. The copilot initially did not understand this instructions but later complied. Two seconds later the Vmo (maximum operating speed) alarm sounded and engine power was reduced to 10%.
The crew attempted to re-establish level flight but failed. The airplane descended out of control and struck the ground at a speed of 366 knots.

The ATR-42 departed SÃ£o Paulo at 04:40 in the morning for a mail flight to Londrina and climbed to its cruising altitude of FL180. Twenty minutes later the
airplane crashed in a field near Paranapanema.

PROBABLE CAUSE:
1. Human Factors
Psychological aspect - Contributing factor
The pilots' perception about the situation was affected by lack of specific training and procedures, which, coupled with the limited time available for action and lack of clarity in communications, influenced the time elapsed for taking corrective actions.
Operational Aspect
a) Coordination Cabin - Contributed
Communication between the crew was not clear at the time of emergency, making the co-pilot did not understand at first, the action to be performed, which increased the time spent to disarm the CB. Such facts, however, can not be separated from the situation experienced by pilots with inadequate training for emergency and in a short time to identify the problem and take the corrective actions.
b) Supervision - Undetermined
The company had not provided a regular CRM training to pilots. Furthermore, the captain did not receive simulator training for over one year. It was impossible to determine, however, if the regular training and updating of the CRM simulator training of the pilot would have prevented the accident.
c) Other Operational Issues - Undetermined
The removal of the pilot from his seat at the time of the emergency may have increased the time spent in identifying the crash and taking corrective actions, but it was not possible to establish whether the accident would be avoided if he would have been in the cockpit.
The co-pilot was slow to understand the situation and initiate corrective actions, although the alarm ""whooler"" has sounded, also increasing the elapsed time.

2. Material Factor
a) Project - Contributed
The operational testing under J IC 27-32-00 allowed the partial completion of the procedures due to lack of clarity, which allowed the release of the aircraft for flight with a defective relay.
Furthermore, although the elevator trim system has been certified, no procedure for emergency triggering of the compensator in the manuals provided by the manufacturer, no replacement intervals of the components of the elevator trim system in ""Time Limits"" systems normal and reserves were not independent and the system had a low tolerance for errors.

After the mishap, the aircraft was withdrawn from use and stored at Fiumicino until it was bought for spares by Dart Aviation in 2005.

CAUSE (translated from Italian): The breakage of the swinging lever (SL) of the left landing gear. The SL is the connecting element between the structure of the landing gear and the wheel - a technical factor.

Turbulence associated with a frontal passage had been forecast en-route but another aircraft flying the same route in the opposite direction reported that no turbulence had been encountered. Whilst in cloud and approximately 50 nm from Dublin the aircraft encountered light turbulence at which point the commander switched on the cabin seat belt signs. The cabin crew member immediately secured the cabin and informed the commander by inter-phone that this had been done. Because the turbulence was only very light she remained standing in the galley, but a few seconds later the aircraft encountered severe turbulence which lasted between 10 and 20 seconds. This was sufficient to throw the cabin crewmember across the galley, causing her to hit the cabin ceiling and a bulkhead before finally throwing her to the floor.
The turbulence stopped and after recovering for a short while the crew member managed to get into her seat and secure the harness, although she found moving and breathing both difficult and painful.
Realising what had happened a passenger asked if she was all right, however she was too shocked and winded to reply. After a further short period she was able to speak to the commander on the inter-phone and inform him of the situation. She was further able to make a pre-landing announcement to passengers to ensure the cabin remained secure, although she was unable to leave her seat. Being aware of the situation the commander requested that an ambulance meet the aircraft. On arrival at Dublin airport he asked the passengers to remain seated so that the First Officer could make his way into the cabin to open the cabin door and attend to the injured crew-member. She was then taken to hospital where an examination showed that she had suffered skeletal muscular injuries.

There were no injuries among the 22 passengers and three crew members.
Danish Air Transport flight DTR54 was on a scheduled flight from Bergen to FlorÃ¸ (FRO). During takeoff the pilots experienced considerable control problems related to the elevator function. They declared an emergency situation and returned for landing. The landing was accomplished without further incident 7 minutes after takeoff.
After landing it was found that the control problems were caused by the right elevator hanging below the horizontal stabiliser, attached only by the inboard of the three hinges that normally connect the elevator to the stabiliser. A bolt was missing from both the centre and outer hinges. Both of the bolts and one of the nuts that normally should connect the hinge assemblies together were found. One of the bolts was found on the runway, the other inside the elevator.
Investigation indicates that the bolt belonging to the outer hinge assembly fell out during the takeoff in question, while the bolt in the centre hinge assembly had fallen out at an earlier point in time, without being discovered. The report concludes that the self-locking nuts cannot have been tightened with the required torque when the elevator was fitted. This error was most probably introduced after the aircraft was repainted in 1999.

Significant investigation results:
The control problems experienced by the crew during take-off and the rest of the flight began when the outboard of the three hinge bolts that attach the right elevator to the stabiliser loosened and fell out. As the centre bolt had fallen out at an earlier point in time without being discovered, the elevator was hanging in place only attached by the inboard hinge.
The self-locking nuts that should hold the centre and outboard hinge bolts in place cannot have been tightened with the required torque.

The radar and several electrical systems were knocked off-line by the strike. Most of the systems were restored, and the airplane landed without incident. The pilot reported that after takeoff, they deviated around a thunderstorm, and that there were numerous thunderstorms in the area. The pilot said after clearing the thunderstorm, they were flying in clear air. He said along the route, most of the observed thunderstorms were behind them, and that they entered instrument meteorological conditions in a large area of cloud cover. As they started a normal descent for the destination airport in smooth air, he indicated that he and the first officer simultaneously noticed that the radio magnetic indicator needles ""spun around in different directions,"" and that an ""instant later"" they were struck by lightning. He did not indicate what was observed on the radar screen. The pilot did not report any mechanical anomalies prior to the lightning strike. Portions of the left aileron's lightning strike protection were de-bonded by the strike, and the aileron was replaced.


Probable Cause: A lightning strike during a normal descent for landing, which resulted in structural damage to the airplane's left aileron.

A cold front had passed over the coast and was on its way east, and local moderate icing was forecast.
While climbing, when passing flight level FL100 (approx. 10,000 ft), ice began to form on the aircraft. The aircraft's de-icing systems were switched on and functioned normally. Nevertheless, more ice built up and, when passing through FL120, there was a marked reduction in the aircraft's climb ability. At FL140 the autopilot disconnected, at much the same time as the aircraft entered an uncommanded roll to approx. 45 degrees to the right and began to lose height. When the crew believed they had regained control, the aircraft suddenly rolled uncommanded to the left in a similar manner. Around one and a half minutes after the first uncommanded roll movement, the climb was stable once more. The flight continued to Gardermoen without any further problems. The loss of altitude in the incident was approx. 1500 ft, and was
not critical in relation to terrain height. No personal injuries or material damage occurred.
In addition to establishing how and why the control of the aircraft was temporarily lost, the AIBN has uncovered several latent contributing factors and safety problems in this investigation. These safety problems can roughly be subdivided into four groups:
- Operation of this aircraft type in icing conditions
- Serious deficiencies in the company's quality system and flight safety programme
- Insufficient follow-up and rule enforcement on the part of the CAA-N after it had disclosed serious deficiencies in the quality system and flight safety programme in its flight operations inspections of the company over several years prior to the incident.
- The company was assigned two new tendered routes despite the deficiencies in its safety management persisting.

In the opinion of the AIBN, this case illustrates the importance well functioning safety regulation has on aviation safety. The failure of the CAA-N follow-up contributed to deficiencies in the Coast
Air quality system and flight safety programme not being corrected in time.

CONTRIBUTING FACTORS (translated from Portuguese report)
Operational Aspect
a. Weather conditions - Contributed
A light rain caused the presence of water on the runway, enabling the occurrence of hydroplaning.
b. Infrastructure - Contributed
The accumulation of water on the surface of the runway, as a result of inadequate drainage, lack of ""grooving"", enabled the hydroplaning.
c. Education - Contributed
The pilot applied full pressure on the right pedal, generating a force to the left that contributed to the departure off the runway.
During hydroplaning, the pilot should not apply pedal to the opposite side to which the aircraft slides; this fact was not covered during the instruction of the pilot.
d. Application of command - Contributed
In the face of hydroplaning, the pilot applied the right pedal, aggravating the departure of the aircraft to the left.

The incident occurred when the aircraft was taking off on a return flight from Bergen to FlorÃ¸. The crew observed that snow was forming on the aircraft during the stopover at Flesland, in addition to remnants of clear ice from the previous flight on the wings, the horizontal tail surface and the propeller spinners. Prior to departure, the aircraft was de-iced and treated with anti-icing fluid.
At 1606 hrs, OY-JRY started its take-off roll at Flesland. In his report, the commander has stated that 15Â° flaps were applied. Mass and centre of gravity was within limitations. 10 kt before achieving rotation speed, the aircraft took off without any input being applied to the controls. The aircraft then continued in a shallow climb at low speed.
According to the commander, the aircraft continued the uncontrolled ascent in spite of both control columns being moved to the full forward position (stop) and engine power being increased. The stick shaker activated and the â€œcricket soundâ€ was heard for a few seconds while the airspeed decreased. Eventually, the nose of the aircraft started to come down and speed gradually increased, at which point the stick shaker ceased. While the speed increased, the crew experienced that the control columns oscillated back and forth and were heavy to operate.
The crew report states that they started on a visual turn to return to Flesland, but abandoned this when the aircraft entered clouds. The climb was then stabilizing, and the controls became gradually easier to move. When the aircraft emerged above the clouds, the crew continued to the destination without using autopilot. The flight controls were inspected after landing at FlorÃ¸ without anything abnormal being found.

MÃ©rida Airport is located in a mountain valley at an elevation of 5010 feet. Terrain in the valley rises from 1000 to 19.500 feet. Arrivals and departures have to use the Rio Chama corridor to the west of the airport. Runway 07 is used for landings and takeoffs have to be performed in the opposite direction, from runway 25.
Santa BÃ¡rbara Airlines however used an unpublished approach and departure procedure which let the aircraft use a valley to the northeast of the airport. This procedure saved about 15 minutes of flying time on the route to Caracas.
After all passengers had boarded for flight 518 to Caracas, it took about 30 minutes for the pilots to arrive at the aircraft. Being late, they immediately started the engines while simultaneously asking for permission to do so.
Because an Avior Airlines flight was approaching the airport, the crew were told to expedite their departure or wait for the arrival of the Avior aircraft. The flight crew decided to go and began taxiing 2 minutes and 40 seconds after startup. Consequently the AHRS (attitude and heading reference) system of the airplane was unusable. The aircraft needed to remain still for 3 minutes after the battery is turned on so that all gyroscopes, accelerometers and magnetometers can be stabilized and synchronized.
The AHRS provides attitude information for aircraft, including roll, pitch and yaw. The captain possibly expected to re-initialize the system while they were at cruising altitude.
After departure from runway 25 the crew planned to use the unpublished procedure. Climbing through clouds a 180-degree turn was initiated. Using the unreliable magnetic compass, the flight made a 270 degree turn, heading towards rising terrain. The captain took over control from the copilot. When visual contact with terrain was regained, the crew noted they were heading for mountains. The captain tried to avoid rising terrain but the aircraft impacted the side of a mountain at 3810 m.

CONCLUSIONS
The attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) as a device was operational, however the initialization of the system was incomplete, so the standard mode was in a fault condition. This failure mode left the RMI or radio magnetic indicators and the autopilot inoperative.
The EGPWS or enhanced ground proximity warning system was inoperative in the ""enhanced"" functions, since the information is displayed on the EFIS system screens, therefore there was no early warning (Visual) of impact against the mountain range.
The GPS was the only instrument capable of providing heading information to within one degree of accuracy. Because it is located on the co-pilot's lower left panel, the information provided by the co-pilot was basically available for co-pilot observation. In addition, the size of the display is relatively small for the information it shows.
The crew was valid, qualified and certified by the National Institute of Civil Aeronautics (INAC). However, the crew was very unconcerned to learn that they were taking off with the AHRS system inoperative and the weather conditions were instrument or IMC.
The meteorological station in Merida was inoperative.
The control tower did not have an operational communications recording system.
According to the deformation shown on the low pressure compressor wheels, the engines had power at the time of impact.

Weather at Lubbock was poor with an overcast at 500 feet, freezing drizzle and mist.
The aircraft encountered icing conditions while en route to Lubbock. And although the airplane accumulated some ice during the flight that degraded its performance, the NTSB determined that the aircraft could have landed safely had the airspeed been maintained.
During the approach to Lubbock runway 17R, at about 1400 feet above the ground and about 90 seconds from the runway, the captain indicated a flight control problem saying, ""We have no flaps."" Although the crewmembers had been trained to perform a go-around and refer to a checklist if a flap problem occurred during an approach, the captain chose to continue the approach as he attempted to troubleshoot the flap anomaly while the first officer flew the plane. Neither flight crewmember adequately monitored the airspeed, which decayed to the extent that the stick shaker activated, which warned of an impending aerodynamic stall.
The captain continued the unstabilized approach even though he received additional stick shaker activations and an aural ""pull up"" warning from the terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS). At that point, the plane was descending at a rate of over 2,000 ft per minute.
Although procedures for responding to either the stick shaker or the TAWS warning require the immediate application of maximum engine power, the captain did not apply maximum power until 17 seconds after the TAWS warning. Seconds after maximum power was applied, the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall and crashed.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crew's failure to monitor and maintain a minimum safe airspeed while executing an instrument approach in icing conditions, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall at low altitude. Contributing to the accident were 1) the flight crew's failure to follow published standard operating procedures in response to a flap anomaly, 2) the captain's decision to continue with the unstabilized approach, 3) the flight crew's poor crew resource management, and 4) fatigue due to the time of day in which the accident occurred and a cumulative sleep debt, which likely impaired the captain's performance.""

During the NDB procedure approach, Rio Tower (TWR-RJ) requested the aircraft crew to reduce speed as an inspection was being conducted on runway 20R due to suspected contamination.
The crew spotted the vehicle conducting the inspection on runway 20R and, once authorized, made the landing on runway 20L. There was valid information (NOTAM) regarding the interdiction of runway 20L.
After landing, the crew spotted the runway closed sign.

Contributing factors:

Concerning the operation of the aircraft
a) Cabin coordination - contributed
To the extent that the crew failed to consider the information received at the beginning of the flight stage (NOTAM) that should have been clearly and recalled during the phases of the flight, especially in the descent briefing. In addition to compliance with the ATIS message that was available.
b) Pilot forgetfulness - undetermined
It is possible that the crew forgot the information available and consulted before the flight.
c) Airport infrastructure - undetermined
It is probable that the type of horizontal signage used to inform of the runway closure was not effective for the wet conditions over the aerodrome and did not allow it to be displayed early enough to avoid landing.

All six crew members and 46 passengers survived the accident.
The domestic passenger flight TGN162 departed Tanjung Redep/Berau-Kalimaru Airport (BEJ) at 10:30 and climbed to Flight Level (FL) 140. Balikpapan approach cleared the crew direct to Samarinda Airport (SRI). The enroute part of the flight was uneventful. On approach to Samarinda, the crew was cleared to track direct to left downwind for runway 04. The controller informed them that the wind was 060 degrees at 12 knots. During the final approach for runway 04, the left ECU (Engine Control Unit) light illuminated followed by low oil pressure and torque indications. The captain decided to go around and divert to Balikpapan-Sepingan Airport (BPN) which was 92 km (50 NM) to the South. The flight crew carried out the engine shut-down procedure and commenced a climb to 4000 ft with the left engine inoperative. Approximately 16 Nm from Balikpapan Airport, while climbing through 3,800 feet, the right ECU light illuminated, immediately followed by low oil pressure and low torque indications. The right engine then failed. The crew broadcast a MAYDAY to Balikpapan Approach and decided to conduct a forced landing into a clear field in the Samboja area, about 16 Nm from the Balikpapan Airport.

CAUSES: ""The both engine were lack of fuel before flame out, it was indicated the fuel management was out of control during flight that might be a misleading of fuel quantity indication. The proper analysis could not be carried out due to both
FDR and CVR were un-operated."" [sic]

Despite this, the aircraft was repeatedly released for service under the MEL without proper analysis or rectification. Refueling was required to be done manually with fuel quantity checks using dipsticks, but the responsible engineer did not supervise the process and delegated it to the first officer. Refueling was incorrectly carried out in automatic mode, and due to the failed indicator, fuel was not loaded into the right tank. As a result, only 229 kg of fuel was present in the right tank before departure, although the total fuel load appeared sufficient for the planned route.

After 47 minutes of flight, the right engine shut down due to fuel exhaustion. The crew did not take immediate corrective actions, and while discussing warnings they failed to monitor flight parameters. Airspeed decreased significantly, angle of attack increased, and the aircraft stalled, losing about 480 meters of altitude. Recovery actions were delayed. The crew then continued flight with one engine, unsuccessfully attempted multiple restarts, depleted the battery, and made inappropriate fuel system manipulations that nearly caused loss of the remaining engine.

The investigation concluded that the serious incident resulted from poor maintenance practices, inadequate preflight preparation and fueling oversight, insufficient crew training for single-engine operations, and weak crew coordination. These factors led to fuel starvation, engine shutdown, loss of airspeed control, stall, and unsafe handling during continued flight."

Both crew followed the advisories.
The ATR-42 was operating flight ISS1834 on behalf of Meridiana from Pantelleria to Palermo, Sicily, Italy. At 13:37 UTC the Pantelleria Tower controller cleared the flight to climb to FL100, but this was read back as FL110. The controller did not notice this incorrect read-back.
Subsequently the Pantelleria Tower controller coordinated with Rome ACC (South Sector) and stated ISS1834 had been cleared to FL100.
At 13:50 the flight switched frequencies to Rome ACC (South Sector), and reported: ""Rome good afternoon ISS1834, passing FL 7-2, climbing 1-1-0, inbound ROBET"". Again, the error in the cleared altitude was not noticed by the controller.
At 13:52 another Meridiana flight, ISS1825 from Palermo to Pantelleria, was being cleared to descend to FL100 by the Rome ACC (South Sector) controller. This clearance was immediately corrected to FL110.
At 13:55:05 both aircraft were at FL110 in opposite directions with a separation of 4.55 NM. Then the TCAS system on both aircraft issued a Resolution Advisory. ISS1825 (MD-82 I-SMEZ) was instructed to descend and ISS1834 (ATR-42 D-BCRN) was instructed to climb.
Separation at 13:55:30 was 0.99 NM horizontal and 200 feet vertical. The vertical separation increased to 1200 feet and both aircraft were able to continue to their respective destinations.

Causes (translated from Italian):
The cause of event is attributable to human factors. The CTA TWR in Pantelleria and CTA EXE SUD of Rome ACC had the false assumption that ISS1834 was actually climbing for the authorized level of FL100, while it was evident that the crew of the flight in question was executing a maneuver to climb up to FL110. Such a false belief caused a lack of vigilance by CTA EXE SUD in the exercise of the radar surveillance, which did not allow a quick detection of a climb beyond authorized limits."

Flight SI-308 took off from Guernsey, Channel Islands at 07:05, with the captain acting as pilot flying. He was conducting line training of the co-pilot, a first officer who had recently joined the company.
The short flight to Jersey was without incident and the weather for landing was reported as good, with the wind from 210Â° at 16 kt, few clouds at 2,000 ft and visibility in excess of 10 km. The commander elected to carry out a visual approach to runway 27 at Jersey, using a planned approach speed of 107 kt and flap 30 selected for landing.
During the approach, the gear was selected down and the flight crew confirmed the three green 'gear safe' indication lights were illuminated, indicating that the gear was locked in the down position. The commander reported that both the approach and touchdown seemed normal, with the crosswind from the left resulting in the left main gear touching first.
Just after touchdown both pilots heard a noise and the aircraft appeared to settle slightly differently from usual. The captain considered that a tyre had burst. The cabin crewmember also heard a noise after touchdown which she too thought was from a tyre bursting. The commander selected ground idle and partial reverse pitch and, as the aircraft decelerated through 70 kt, the co-pilot took over control of the ailerons, as per standard procedures, to allow the commander to take control of the steering tiller. Despite applying corrective inputs the aircraft continued rolling to the left.
The aircraft continued to quickly roll to the left until the left wingtip and propeller contacted the runway. The aircraft remained on the runway, rapidly coming to a halt to the left of the centreline, approximately abeam Holding Point D. Both propellers continued to rotate and the commander selected the condition levers to the fuel shutoff position and pulled the fire handles to shut both engines down.

It was determined that the left side brace upper arm had suffered a fatigue failure. The failure rendered the side brace ineffective and the unrestrained main trunnion continued to translate outboard, leading to the collapse of the gear. The aluminium brace was found to contain a small metallurgical feature at the crack origin which was consistent with titanium rich particles (TiB2) particles which are introduced as a grain refiner during casting of the billet prior to forging. The size of the feature was within the defined specifications for AL7010-T74. Analysis of the area surrounding the crack origin revealed an area of static loading before propagating a crack in fatigue, indicating that there may have been a single overload event at some point in the history of the side brace upper arm.

PROBABLE CAUSE: The investigation report did not contain a probable cause paragraph as recommended in ICAO Annex 13.

19 Oct 2013,ATR 42-320 (F),P2-PXY,"Air Niugini, lsf Farnair Switzerland",0,Madang Airport (MAG),sub,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/320658,ATR 42-300,AT43,09:15,087,Pratt & Whitney Canada PW121,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 3,0,Accident,Take off,Cargo,Madang Airport (MAG/AYMD),Tabubil Airport (TBG/AYTB),"An ATR-42-320F cargo plane sustained substantial damage in a runway excursion accident at Madang Airport (MAG), Papua New Guinea.
The airplane, P2-PXY, operated on a domestic cargo flight from Port Moresby to Madan, Tabubil and then back to Port Moresby.
During taxi at Port Moresby, the anti-skid warning light illuminated. The flight crew stopped the aircraft, carried out the relevant checklist, and determined from the aircraft performance charts that it was permissible to land at Madang with the anti-skid inoperative. The flight to Madang was normal and the aircraft landed there at 07:32. While on the ground, the freight from Port Moresby was off-loaded and a cargo consisting entirely of cigarettes, packaged in large cardboard cartons, was loaded for Tabubil and Port Moresby.
The aircraft taxied to depart from runway 25 at 09:15. The flight crew used the full length of the runway and the takeoff roll was normal until the Pilot-in-Command, who was the handling pilot, tried to rotate at VR (which the flight crew had calculated to be 102 knots). The controls felt very heavy in pitch and he could not pull the control column back in the normal manner. After approximately two seconds the Pilot-in-Command aborted the takeoff and selected full reverse thrust, and he later applied full braking. It was not possible to stop the aircraft before the end of the runway and it continued over the embankment at the end of the runway and the right wing struck the perimeter fence. This caused the aircraft to yaw to the right and it entered a creek beyond the perimeter fence at approximately 45 degrees to its direction of movement. The aircraft came to rest in a small creek, with the forward 4/5 of the fuselage in the water and the cockpit mostly submerged.
The right outboard wing section caught fire and the flight crew escaped through the hatch in the cockpit roof. The Pilot-in-Command, who was the last to remain on board, discharged the fire extinguishers in each engine and switched off the battery master switch before leaving the aircraft.
The investigation found that the aircraft total load exceeded the maximum permissible load and the load limit in the forward cargo zone Â‘AÂ’ exceeded the zone Â‘AÂ’ structural limit. The mass and the centre of gravity of the aircraft were not within the prescribed limits.
The weight for cargo compartment Â‘AÂ’ as calculated by the pilots for the weight and balance of the aircraft should have been 350 kg. However, this was exceeded by 786 kg.
The maximum (permissible) all up weight was 16,900 kg. The Load Chart listed the MAUW accepted by the PIC as 16,606 kg. However, the actual total cargo weight was 597 kg heavier than listed on the load sheet, therefore, the aircraft was 343 kg heavier than the permissible MAUW.

Contributing factor:
The investigation found that Air NiuginiÂ’s lack of robust loading procedures and supervision for the ATR 42/72 aircraft, and the inaccurate weights provided by the consignor/client company likely contributed to the overload.
Other factors:
a) The Madang Airport fire-fighting tender vehicle did not have sufficient capacity to fight a more extensive aircraft fire involving an aircraft larger than the ATR 42.
b) The Madang Airport did not meet the ICAO Annex 14 Standard with respect to the required aerodrome category 6, for rescue and fire-fighting services.
c) The Madang Airport did not meet the ICAO Annex 14 Standard with respect to the runway end safety areas.
d) The Madang Airport did not meet the ICAO Annex 14 Standards with respect to the required Airport Emergency Plan.

All 49 passengers and five crew members sustained fatal injuries.
The ATR-42 departed Jayapura at 14:22 LT (05:22 UTC) and was expected to arrive at Oksibil at 15:04 LT (06:04 UTC).
At 14:55 the pilot made first contact with Oksibil Aerodrome Flight Information Services (AFIS), reporting cruising at 11500 feet over position Ambisibil. The AFIS controller acknowledged the message and instructed the pilot to report when overhead the airport. The pilot reported that they intended to fly a direct left base leg for runway 11. The Oksibil AFIS officer then told the pilot to continue approach and to call when position on final for runway 11.
There was no further contact with the flight.
The aircraft wreckage was found the next day on a ridge of Tanggo Mountain at approximately 8,300 feet AMSL, about 17 km from the airport.

The investigators concluded that the flight crew deviated from the standard approach procedure over mountainous terrain. There was no EGPWS warning nor any other EGPWS callout during the descent. The Oksibil Airport was not provided with the high-resolution terrain data in the database version installed on the accident aircraft's EGPWS.
Additionaly, some pilots within the air operator had experiences that the EGPWS warning became active in a condition that according to the pilots, the warning is not appropriate. These experiences led to the pilot behaviour of pulling the EGPWS circuit breaker to eliminate nuisance of EGPWS warning that considered unnecessary.
The investigators could not determine the actual EGPWS CB position during the accident flight.

Contributing Factors:
1. The deviation from the visual approach guidance in visual flight rules without considering the weather and terrain condition, with no or limited visual reference to the terrain resulted in the aircraft flew to terrain.
2. The absence of EGPWS warning to alert the crew of the immediate hazardous situation led to the crew did not aware of the situation.

Meanwhile a passenger coach was assigned to carry two of the cabin crew members from the Terminal Building to Bay No.22 to operate Jet Airways flight 9W-2881, scheduled to depart at 06:10 hrs IST. The passenger coach deviated from the vehicular lane and crashed into the starboard side main landing gear area of the parked ATR aircraft VT-ABO in Bay No. 32. The cabin crew members and the driver on board the passenger coach disembarked immediately from the right side of the coach as the coach was stuck under the starboard wing/engine. The impact was strong and it damaged the starboard undercarriage, starboard engine exhaust and the wing inboard trailing edge. The passenger coach also sustained damages. There were no injuries to the persons in the coach and no evidence of fire was observed.

Probable Cause
Involuntary dozing of the Driver while driving on the apron has resulted into collision of coach with the aircraft.

The aircraft took off from Nice-CÃ´te d'Azur Airport (NCE), France, on a flight to FLR. The Pilot Flying in the left seat was a captain undergoing training. The instructor pilot and Pilot Not Flying was seated on the right.
The climbing and cruising phases were uneventful.
During the approach, the Tower controller cleared the flight to land on runway 05. The instructor captain then requested an approach to runway 23 for training purposes. This was authorized by the Tower controller.
The pilots then proceeded downwind and prepared for a Circle-to-Land approach. They were keeping an altitude of 2500 feet until the base leg.
During the base turn, the PNF selected the flaps to 35Â° and urged the PF the push the nose down. In the descending turn the GPWS sounded multiple times with 'Sink Rate' and 'Pull up' warnings.
The aircraft then crossed the threshold with an indicated speed of about 145 kts.

The aircraft touched down for the first time about 450 m from the touchdown zone and bounced twice.
At a speed of about 104 kts and at less than 350 m from the end of the available runway, the aircraft put its wheels firmly on the runway. Braking was applied immediately,
The aircraft continued across the grassy terrain until it crashed into the airport net-fencing at the edge of the A11 motorway, and the aircraft came to a complete standstill, with the left engine still running.

CAUSES
The crew planned and carried out the MVL (Circle-to-Land) approach which took the aircraft to an approach flight path incompatible with respect to the safety parameters set down by the company standards.
Despite the activation of the alarm systems, the expected go-around manoeuvre was not started also because of an insufficient crew coordination between the two flight crew members.
The presence of a significant wind component from the north cannot be completely excluded, which further destabilized the spatial flight path of the aircraft.

The airplane returned to Cartagena for an emergency landing. An initial examination of the No. 2 engineÂ’s propeller assembly revealed one of the six blades had separated through the metal base just outboard of the propeller hub. An adjacent blade was fractured through the composite airfoil at about the midspan area. The examination of the engine revealed that both of the forward engine mounts had broken, and the engine sagged to the bottom of the engine cowling.

PROBABLE CAUSE: (translated from original Spanish language report) ""Preventive maintenance programs which did not allow the detection of corrosion in the base of the blade with serial number FR341 leading to fatigue and separation thereof.""

The crew performed – from memory – the required emergency checklist actions (in-flight engine fire or severe mechanical damage). The propeller of the malfunctioned engine was set to feather.
The crew declared an emergency by reporting MAYDAY and requested an immediate landing. The Tower secured runway 13L for the emergency landing.
The captain took the aircraft into a tight right turn while the first officer initiated the fire extinguishing system by discharging first the agent No 1 then No 2. The fire inside the engine nacelle was successfully put out.
The passengers saw the flames and the smoke coming out of the engine nacelle. Some smoke was visible inside the main cabin which caused panic among the passengers.
A single engine landing was performed on runway 13L. Once the aircraft stopped on a taxiway, the passengers were evacuated on the captain’s command.
The aerodrome emergency services were waiting for the aircraft but there was no need for intervention because the fire had already been stopped.

Conflicting traffic was a Dubai Government registered Agusta Westland AW139 helicopter, which was flying VFR routing along the coast, out of Dubai via Khasab city, Habalayn, Diba and back to Dubai. When the incident took place, the helicopter was on right turn at 1500ft QNH after having cleared a hill West of Khasab, heading East with intention to cross the extended centreline of runway 19. The helicopter pilot had not been able to establish radio contact with Khasab ATC, the traffic information on his TCAS (helicopter TCAS has no Resolution Advisory capability). Due to the right turn, the helicopter pilot didn' t have visual contact with the ATR-42 traffic thus there is no any avoidance maneuver from the helicopter. Both aircraft continued their intented flights, the ATR landed safely and the helicopter continued its flight as planned back to Dubai with no further events. Minimum separation was evaluated by the ATR flight crew, as 150ft vertically and INM horizontally. There were no reports of any injury nor any damage.

During the rotation, the captain noticed that the aircraft hit a tapir. Subsequently, the right main landing gear did not retract. The hydraulic systems were affected by the collision and the crew decided to proceed to Manaus with the landing gear down.
During the landing, after the touchdown of the broken landing gear on the ground, the aircraft turned to the right. The crew managed to keep the aircraft within the lateral limits of the runway. The aircraft had substantial damage.
The 4 crew members and the 45 passengers left unharmed.

Contributing factors.
- Airport infrastructure - a contributor.
The lack of isolation of the operational area allowed the land animal to enter the runway for landings and takeoffs, contributing to the accident.
- Perception - a contributor.
The crew did not notice the presence of the land animal on the runway early enough to abort the takeoff without extrapolating the runway limits and avoiding collision.
- Wild - a contributor.
The presence of the land animal (Tapirus terrestris) interfered with the operation and led to the collision of the right main landing gear.

Before the first flight the aircraft was refueled. The indicated total fuel onboard was 3339 kilos.
The flights to Stavanger and back to Esbjerg were performed as a line check of the left-hand seated pilot training for an upgrade to commander.
At Esbjerg, the trainee pilot had passed the line check and acted as commander of the flight from Esbjerg to Billund.
The aircraft took off from runway 26 at Esbjerg and at around 1000 feet altitude mean sea level the right engine flamed out. The flight crew performed the ‘engine flame out at take-off’ emergency checklist memory items.
When the aircraft was stabilized at 3000 feet (msl) altitude, and no engine damage was suspected, the flight crew performed the ‘engine restart in flight’ checklist. For a few seconds, the engine interstage turbine temperature increased, but the engine did not restart. After completion of the ‘single engine operation checklist’ and other remaining checklist items, the flight crew informed Esbjerg Aerodrome Flight Information Service (AFIS) about the engine flame out, and that the flight crew intended to continue the flight to EKBI.
Esbjerg AFIS informed Billund Air Traffic Control (ATC) about the situation.
The aircraft was transferred to Billund Approach (APP) and continued to Billund with only the left engine operating.
On approach to Billund, the flight crew got radar vectors from Billund Approach and established the aircraft on the localizer to runway 27. The aircraft was transferred to Billund Tower (TWR).
Billund TWR informed the flight crew that the Instrument Landing System (ILS) category 1 was in operation and that the flight crew of the previously landed aircraft reported the approach lights in sight at an altitude of 200 feet above ground level.
On short final to runway 27, the commander (non-flying) observed that the left engine torque indication had dropped to zero, the autopilot disconnected, and the first officer (pilot flying) removed his left hand from the power lever and grabbed the control wheel with both hands.
The commander rapidly moved the left engine power lever forward. At the same time, the flight crew and the cabin crew heard loud bangs from the left engine. The cabin crew observed flames at the rear bottom of the left engine and reported ’engine fire’ to the flight crew.
Shortly after, the aircraft landed on runway 27. The aircraft vacated runway 27 via taxiway C. Because engine fire was reported by the cabin crew, the flight crew stopped the aircraft on taxiway C. The flight crew pulled the fire handles and discharged the fire bottles of both engines.
The cabin crew observed no fire from the left engine. The cabin crew evacuated the passengers via the airstair door located at the rear end of the cabin on the left side of the aircraft fuselage. The fire and rescue services observed no fire from the engines.

Conclusions:
Shortly after take off from Esbjerg (EKEB), the right engine flamed out due to fuel starvation.
Despite the fuel quantity indication system indicated more than 500 kg of fuel in the right tank, the right fuel tank was later found to be empty.
During the single engine approach, the left engine suddenly suffered from compressor stall, and flames were seen from the exhaust. The flight crew interpreted the flames as being an engine fire.
Upon landing, the aircraft vacated the runway, the left engine was shut down, and the crew evacuated the aircraft.
The safety investigation found that the fault in the fuel quantity indication system originated from the right tank probe no. 3.
Few months prior to the serious incident, maintenance personnel removed and reinstalled the fuel tank probes. The AIB finds it probable that the fault on probe no. 3 was introduced during this process.
The left engine suffered from high deterioration and damages to the hot section. This made the engine subjectable to compressor stall.

7 Dec 2016,ATR 42-500,AP-BHO,Pakistan International Airlines - PIA,47,"6,5 km SSE of Havelian",w/o,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/319967,ATR 42-500,AT45,16:20,663,P&W Canada PW127E,Fatalities: 47 / Occupants: 47,0,Accident,En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Chitral Airport (CJL/OPCH),Islamabad International Airport (ISB/OPRN),"Pakistan International Airlines flight 661, an ATR 42-500, was destroyed after impacting a hillside near Havelian, Pakistan. All 47 on board were killed.

The aircraft took off from Chitral at 15:38 hours local time, bound for Islamabad. The first officer, who was undergoing route training, was Pilot Flying (PF) and the captain was Pilot Monitoring (PM). A third first officer who was already route cleared, was in the jump seat.
The aircraft levelled off at FL135 at an Indicated Air Speed (IAS) of 186 knots about 10 minutes after takeoff. The aircraft failed to attain the expected cruise speed of 230 knots.
The flight remained uneventful till 16:04:55. While the captain was engaged in a passenger announcement, the Propeller Electronic Control of the left side propeller (PEC-1) Single Channel fault appeared, followed by PEC-1 Fault.
The captain interrupted the announcement and asked for the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) with abnormal procedures. The first officer asked to bring the power back and asked the captain to call the engineer, who was travelling as a passenger, to the cockpit.
Reduction in power resulted in a gradual drop in the IAS to 146 knots. The flight crew attempted to rectify the fault using the checklist, but all three attempts to reset the PEC failed.
The no.1 propeller blade pitch angle was not under the control of the PEC anymore. The blade pitch angle increased and there was an unusual decrease in the propeller speed. No. 1 propeller speed (Np-1) decreased from a normal in flight value of 82% to 62%.
At 16:07:26, the first officer cautioned about the decreasing airspeed and as a result both power levers were advanced. The IAS gradually started to increase to over 160 knots. The trainee first officer in the right-hand seat then changed seats with the other first officer. The engineer had by then joined the crew on the flight deck to help troubleshoot the issue. Despite discussing the problem, the pilots and engineer were uncertain of the origin of the fault and what to do about it.
At 16:10:33, at an airspeed of about 196 knots, a transient sound was heard, which was followed by a sudden abnormal noise. The no.1 engine torque dropped from 75% to 0% and the propeller speed (Np-1) increased rapidly from 61.5% to 102%. Additionally the Interstage Turbine Temperature (ITT) increased. The torque reducing to zero meant that the no.1 engine had failed. However, Np-1 increasing rapidly to 102% and an increase in ITT were unusual.
The flight crew then started actions to accomplish for an engine flame out. An immediate action for an engine flame out was to retard power of the effected engine. However, the captain had retarded both power levers.
The rotating no.1 propeller caused drag and an asymmetric condition, more than what is usually expected in single engine flight envelope. This drag was estimated to be three times more than the value that is experienced during a usual single engine flight envelope when the propeller is in feathered position.
The IAS continued to decrease to 154 knots as the pilots worked the check list. The flight crew attempted to feather the propeller, and power on engine no.2 was increased.
At 16:11:19, the captain asked the first officer to request a lower altitude (7500 ft AMSL) and issue a Mayday call. The Np-1 propeller speed stayed below 25%, a value similar to that expected for a feathered propeller, for about 40 to 45 seconds. Subsequently Np-1 started to increase again. Initially at a slow rate and then at a very fast rate: from about 50% to 120-125% in 8 seconds. The first officer requested a lower altitude, changed over to Islamabad Approach, reported at position TYPO, but failed to make the Mayday call.
All protections of the propeller control had apparently failed as the propeller blade pitch angle decreased further. The blade pitch angle reaching low values at a high rotational speed generated immense drag. The captain was alarmed by the sound made by the increase in propeller speed and changed the power setting for engine no.2 to check if that had any effect on the noise, which it didn't.
At 16:12:14 the Auto-Pilot (AP) disengaged as it was no longer able to cope with the drag to maintain the target aircraft parameters. Control inputs by the captain were not enough to maintain direction. With further reduction in IAS to about 120 knots, the control input requirement increased and the captain was unable to counter the left-hand turn of the aircraft.
The flight crew attempted to feather the propeller again, but were not successful. The state of engine no.1 and its propeller was very unusual. It was not possible for the cockpit crew to understand the nature and extent of the technical malfunctions.
Due to the substantial drag caused by the no.1 propeller and the low power setting, the aircraft was just short of a stalled condition. At 16:12:36 the stall warning sounded and the stick shaker activated briefly. Power on engine no.2 was advanced, coupled with excessive right rudder input to counter the asymmetric condition. At 16:12:44 this coincided with an abrupt drop in the propeller speed. A considerable amount of drag was suddenly eliminated from the left side of the aircraft, causing a immediate yaw to the right side, with the aircraft entering into a stalled flight condition. During this rapid descent and a roll the aircraft lost about 5100 ft altitude to 8350 ft AMSL. The aircraft first rolled right by about 360Â° and then further rolled by another about 90Â° and then subsequently rolled left to a wings level state. Control had been regained but the flight crew was emotionally shaking by this event.
Np-1 had stabilized lower than 5%, and the blade pitch angle was at low pitch. At this position the generated drag value was around 2,000 lbf, which was about seven times more than the drag a propeller can usually produce in feathered state during a single engine flight. The aircraft was unable to fly a level flight and could only fly in a gradual descent profile. Directional control was only possible with substantial right rudder and right aileron inputs.
The flight crew contacted the approach controller and requested shorter vectors with priority landing at Islamabad Airport along with a Mayday calls.
After 16:17:20 the aircraft started to turn left again with an aim to reach Islamabad Airport. While the power lever was advanced to 81.7Â°, and the torque was 99.8%, the IAS had gradually decreased to 156 knots. A gradually reducing control effectiveness, and an excessive drag of the left side of the aircraft, resulted in a corresponding increase in control input requirement.
At 16:18:45 the stall warning horn sounded again for 3.5 seconds. The aircraft altitude and IAS kept on decreasing to 4809 ft AMSL (2168 ft AGL) and 128 knots, and kept turning left with progressively increasing right control inputs from the cockpit crew. At 16:18:52 the Terrain Avoidance Warning System (TAWS) alarm began to sound.
At 16:20:23 the aircraft was continuously turning left, with progressively increasing right control inputs. The IAS was reducing through 120 knots and the aircraft stalled at 850 ft AGL.
It impacted the side of a mountain and disintegrated.

The investigation revealed that the sequence of events was initiated with the dislodging of one turbine blade of Power Turbine Stage (PT-1) of engine no. 1 due to fatigue. According to a Service Bulletin these turbines blades were to be changed after completion of 10,000 hours, on immediate next maintenance opportunity. The engine in question was under maintenance on November 11, 2016, and at that time these blades had completed 10004 hours and were thus due for a change. This action was not accomplished.
The aircraft flew approximately 93 hours after this maintenance activity before it crashed on December 7.

Probable Causes of Occurrence.
9. Probable Primary Factors.
(a) The dislodging / fracture of one PT-1 blade of No 1 Engine triggered a chain of events. Unusual combination of fractured / dislodged PT-1 blade with two latent factors caused off design performance of the aircraft and resulted into the accident.
(b) The dislodging / fracture of PT-1 blade of No 1 Engine occurred after omission from the EMM (Non-Compliance of SB-21878) by PIA Engineering during an unscheduled maintenance performed on the engine in November 2016, in which the PT-1 blades had fulfilled the criteria for replacement, but were not replaced.
(c) Fracture / dislodging of PT-1 blade in No 1 Engine, after accumulating a flying time slightly more than the soft life of 10,000 hrs (ie at about 10004.1 + 93 hrs) due to a known quality issue. This aspect has already been addressed by re-designing of PT-1 blades by P&WC.

Probable Contributory Factors.
(a) A fractured pin (and contamination inside the OSG), contributed to a complex combination of technical malfunctions. The pin fractured because of improper re-assembly during some unauthorized / un-documented maintenance activity. It was not possible to ascertain exact time and place when and where this improper re-assembly may have occurred.
(b) Contamination / debris found in overspeed line of PVM of No 1 Engine probably introduced when the propeller system LRU""s were not installed on the gearbox, contributed to un-feathering of the propeller. It was not possible to ascertain exact time and place when and where this contamination was introduced.

There were no injuries, but the aircraft sustained substantial damage.
After approximately one hour and ten minutes of flight time, during the descent procedure, the no.2 propeller rpm suddenly increased. The crewmembers performed the procedures set out in the aircraft manuals and proceeded to their destination.
The crew carried out an NDB approach to runway 09 at Coari-Urucu Airport in light rain conditions.

After touchdown the right propeller did not assume the reverse pitch with the throttle in position below Ground Idle. The aircraft then yawed to the left and veered off the runway approximately 500 m after the touchdown point, traveling about 180 m through the grass.

Contributing factors.
- Attention Â– a contributor.
The lack of attention to the lighting of the Low Pitch lights contributed to the application of reverse in both engines, with only one of the lights on.
Thus, this action contributed to the asymmetric reverse condition, which allowed the aircraft to exit the runway on the left.
- Emotional state Â– undetermined.
The feeling of apprehension experienced by the crewmembers in relation to the length of the runway, associated with the condition of night operation and in the rain, may have affected their performance, so that, in an attempt to anticipate the engines entering the reverse regime, the standard landing procedures were not properly performed.
- Aircraft maintenance Â– undetermined.
The series of discrepancies identified in the Microswitch Box, PN 11S76180650-10, SN 0199, indicating that the unit could have been opened in an unauthorized location, raised doubts about the quality standard of the services performed on the aircraft, which may have allowed an aircraft grounding condition fault that has affected several aircraft electrical components and caused the Np Cancel function to fail.

There were no personal injuries.
After landing on runway 08 of Chișinău International Airport (KIV), the flight crew lost directional control and the aircraft exited the runway on the right side. It rolled on the grass for almost 90 m. The crew tried to return to the runway surface by using steering and ailerons and by applying a thrust differential of the engines.
When the aircraft returned to the runway surface, the main landing gear wheels hit the concrete support of a signal light situated on the runway edge. The aircraft performed an accentuated turn to the left, crossed the runway diagonally and exited on the opposite side (runway left side), stopping with the landing gear on the grass surface on the edge.

>> LUKK 041500Z 17014KT CAVOK 25/13 Q1015 R08/D NOSIG

The probable cause of this serious incident is the inadequate operation of the control column and rudder pedal after the aircraft touchdown, which led to the partial loss of aircraft control during rolling and to the impossibility of maintaining it within the runway rolling surface limits.

Contributing factors were the:
Failure to perform the Descent Check during the approach flight
Failure to correct heading deviation smoothly, using the rudder above 70 kt and progressively the steering (hydraulic nose wheels control system on ground) below 70 kt
Failure to operate the aircraft braking system."

After establishing localizer for the final approach to runway 25L the first officer (Pilot Flying) felt a dissymmetry in the flight conditions. The captain took over the controls. The Master caution light along with EEC light and subsequently PEC light of engine no.1 came on. This was followed by the unwinding of all parameters and an un-commanded inflight shutdown of engine no.1.
Checklist actions were taken and the aircraft landed safely out of the same approach. There were 41 passengers and 4 crew members on board. The aircraft landed safely with no injuries.

Cause of the Occurrence: The occurrence was caused due to failure of No 30 Bearing of the engine however the exact cause of No 30 Bearing failure couldnâ€™t be established due to excessive damage.

At the start of the descent the left main gear door separated from the aircraft.
A safe landing was carried out.

Contributing factors
The loss of the nut on the rear assembly of the left main gear door resulted in the separation of the left main gear door from the aircraft. However, the exact cause of the loss of the nut could not be determined.
However, examination of the left and right landing gear door fasteners of F-GPYF, as well as those of the HOP! fleet of ATR 42 aircraft, revealed defects in the conformity of these assemblies.
The investigation revealed errors in the generic maintenance documentation that may lead to the installation of out-of-date screw/nut combinations. The consequences of these deviations from good practice on the performance of the assembly could not be precisely determined during the investigation but may lead to a loss of function of the assembly.
Thus, the following combinations of organizational and human factors potentially contributed to the loosening and subsequent unscrewing of the nut on the rear assembly of the left main landing gear door:
- The ATR maintenance documentation concerning the choice of nuts to be used as an alternative to P/N IPC is complex and contains errors that could lead to an inadequate P/N nut choice ;
- The information on the torque to be applied on this nut and for all these alternatives was missing from the ATR maintenance documentation;
- The generic ATR maintenance documentation allows the reuse of nuts without checking their self-locking capacity. The work card for the removal/installation of train doors does not specify that it is a self-locking nut and does not require checking its self-locking capacity or its replacement by a new nut.

While approaching Gilgit for landing, the aircraft descended at speeds much higher than normal. As a result of a higher speed and reduced reaction time, the flight crew was unable to extend Flaps 35, as a result of which the aircraft made a high-speed touchdown with Flaps 15. After touchdown, the aircraft could not be stopped within the remaining length of runway and departed off the end. It finally stopped in the overrun of runway 25 at a distance of 41 feet from the threshold. During the occurrence none of the passengers or crew sustained any injuries.

After the overrun, the right-hand main gear collapsed. The right hand propeller blades then struck the ground, causing all the propeller blades to break at approximately one third position from the propeller hub. Propeller fragments then impacted the side of the fuselage.

Primary Causes: -
1. Involuntary Runway Excursion (RE) due intentional high-speed Approach and Landing by PF.
2. Failure to adhere to SOPs.
3. Lack of situational awareness and anticipation resulting in inadequate decision making.

Contributing Factors:
1 Lack of assertiveness by PM.
2 Inadequate application of Crew Resource Management (CRM).

The pilot, copilot and seventeen passengers died in the accident.

The aircraft took off from Dar es Salaam at 06:10 hours Local Time and the estimated time of arrival al Bukoba was 08:25. The enroute weather was reported to be fine and the flight to Bukoba was uneventful.
The weather at Bukoba was good up to 08:20 when it abruptly changed and started raining with thunderstorms and strong winds. The reported visibility reduced from 10 km to 2 km.
The flight reached Bukoba at 08:25 to find that the weather had changed several minutes earlier. There were thunderstorms, Cumulonimbus (CBs) clouds and strong winds. According to eye witnesses the aircraft circled twice in the Bukoba area and the crew advised the passengers that the flight may have to divert to Mwanza if the weather at Bukoba did not improve.
However, on the third attempt, the runway became visible and the pilot initiated the approach to runway 31. On final approach the aircraft impacted the water of Lake Victoria. The main landing gear separated and the cabin floor was dislodged by the impact, allowing water to enter the cabin at high pressure as the aircraft decelerated before coming to a stop.

Canoes and fishermen arrived after about 5 minutes and they transferred the survivors to their boats. Two crew members and 22 passengers were rescued.

Bukoba has a single runway (13/31), 1385 m long. Distance between the shore and the runway 31 threshold is 130 meters.

Causal factor
The accident was caused by an unstabilized final approach to runway 31 of Bukoba airport conducted in poor weather conditions which did not allow clear sight of the terrain. This led the aircraft to strike the water on the lake surface.
Contributory factors
The major contributory factors were:
i. The decision of the Pilot in Command to proceed with the final approach without the required weather minima in order to reach the runway instead of diverting to Mwanza;
ii. The gusting crosswind which prevailed at the time of final approach;
iii. The heavy rain and turbulence at that material time
iv. The absence of air traffic services at Bukoba Airport
v. High rate of descent at low altitude
vi. No immediate response to the EGPWS warnings
vii. High work load to the crew at the critical phase of final approach.

The flight had arrived from Biak at 10:19 and was continuing to Jayapura at the time of the accident.
On this sector the captain acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM) and the first officer acted as Pilot Flying (PF).
During takeoff, after both power levers had been advanced to the notch, both engines torque and NP (propeller rpm) increased as expected. After that, the right engine torque continued increasing to a maximum of 116 percent, while the left engine torque remained at 90 percent. At the same time, NP of the right engine dropped to 72 percent while NP of the left engine remained at 100 percent.
The aircraft speed continued increasing to about 100 knots, when both pilots realized that the aircraft engines had an abnormal condition. The captain decided to cancel the take-off by retarding the power levers and selected to reverse. The aircraft then veered to the left off the runway and stopped about 1,200 meters from the beginning of runway 28.

After the aircraft had stopped, the flight attendants were waiting for an evacuation command from the captain for 10 seconds but there was no command. The flight attendants then decided to evacuate the passengers using all four doors.

During the takeoff roll a Propeller Electronic Control (PEC) number 2 fault was shown and as the aircraft veered off the runway, a PEC 1 fault appeared as well.
The recent maintenance history shows that the PEC 2 fault appeared in-flight on two previous occasions, on 27 and 30 August 2024.

The aircraft struck the signs marking the entrance to this runway.

Causes of the serious incident
Insufficient preparation of the flight by the crew and the lack of warning by the operations office contributed to a lack of awareness of the temporary provisions relating to work on the runway and entered in the flight dossier. During the flight, although the presence of the work was reported to the crew on several occasions, only the ATIS formally indicated the presence of a displaced threshold. However, the position of the latter or the particularities of the approach (APAPI, blue marking) were not indicated to the crew during the approach. In these conditions, a landing beyond the temporary displaced threshold was based solely on its visual detection by the crew.
However, the arrangement of the three white runway closure crosses on the first 600 metres of runway, combined with the presence of the usual and definitive markings that are particularly visible on the newly renovated section of runway, led the pilots to define an end point located immediately after the last cross but before the temporary displaced threshold, in the area still under construction.
The controller's detection of the deviation in the vertical trajectory of the aircraft from the temporary procedure was too late to allow a go-around and avoid the serious incident.

4 Apr 2016,ATR 42-600,PK-TNJ,TransNusa Aviation Mandiri,0,Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP),w/o,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/320101,ATR 42-600,AT46,19:57,1015,Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127M,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 2,0,Accident,Pushback / towing,-,-,-,"Batik Air flight ID7703, operated by a Boeing 737-800 with registration PK-LBS, collided with an ATR-42-600 aircraft on takeoff from runway 24 at Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP), Indonesia. Dark, night time conditions existed at the time of the accident.
The ATR-42-600, operated by TransNusa Aviation Mandiri and registered PK-TNJ, was parked at stand B-1 on the north apron of Halim Airport and was to be moved from the north to the south apron. For this the aircraft had to cross the active runway.
A towing car was used with a driver and one supporting personnel. Two engineers occupied the pilot seats in the aircraft. The engineers were assigned to apply aircraft brakes if required during the towing process.
The towed aircraft was towed without aircraft electrical power fed to the system and the navigation light, strobe light and the aircraft radio communications were off. The communication between the towing car driver and Halim Tower was performed by a handheld radio communication on frequency 152.7 MHz.
At 19:45 local time flight ID7703 requested pushback clearance to the Halim Tower controller on frequency 118.6 MHz. The aircraft was parked on parking stand B-2 and was approved to push back.
After the ID7703 completed the pushback, the towing car driver of the towed aircraft requested clearance to Halim Tower Control Unit to reposition from parking stand B-1 to the south apron. The towing car driver was instructed to follow ID7703 and to report when on taxiway C. The communication between the towing car driver and Halim Tower was handled by the assistant controller.
The controller heard the communication between the assistant and towing car driver, he recognized the position of the towed aircraft was on the parking stand B-1.
The ID7703 flight crew did not know that there was a towing aircraft behind as communications with the car were on a different frequency. At 19:48, ID7703 received taxi clearance to runway 24 via taxiway C.
At 19:50, the controller instructed ID7703 to hold on taxiway C due to an arriving aircraft. The assistant stated that when ID7703 was holding on short taxiway C, the towing car began moving the ATR-42.
At 19:53, ID7703 received clearance from controller to enter runway 24 to back track for departure. The aircraft that had just arrived would use parking stand B-1. Therefore, the assistant controller instructed the towing car driver to expedite the tow and report when on taxiway C. The controller was not observing the ATR at that time. The towing car was about to enter taxiway C at that time.
At 19:56, ID7703 reported ready for takeoff. The controller did not see any vehicle or object on the runway then issued clearance for takeoff. The pilot stated that during line up, the lights surrounding the turn pad were very bright and affected his forward vision for a short time. It was common practice in Halim to lineup at the turn pad beyond the threshold runway 24.
After receiving the takeoff clearance, the Second in Command (SIC) as pilot flying (PF) opened the power and pressed the Take Off / Go Around (TOGA) button.
The towing car driver stated that, when he saw ID7703 was lining up for takeoff, he asked Halim Tower whether ID7703 was initiating the takeoff. There was no reply from Halim Tower. The towing car driver then sped up the towing and turned to the right side of the runway.
When ID7703 was accelerating through approximate 80 knots, the SIC saw an object warned the captain. The pilots could not identify the object but later on when the object became closer, the SIC realized that there was an aircraft.
The captain took over control and applied the right rudder towards the right side of runway centerline and maintained a course between the runway centerline and the runway edge. The PIC intended to reject the takeoff shortly after they felt an impact. The impact occurred at a ground speed of about 130 knots, after passing V1. The pilot rejected takeoff and the aircraft stopped at approximately 400 meter from the towed aircraft which stopped at the left of the runway 24 centerline at approximately 100 meters from taxiway G.
The captain noticed fire on the left wing tip and immediately shut down both engines, activated the fire extinguishers of both engines and Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) and commanded to the flight attendant ""evacuation from the right"".
The flight attendants opened all aircraft passenger doors and the escape slides deployed. Most of passengers were evacuated from the left forward door (L1).
Both aircraft sustained substantial damage. There were no reported injuries to the accident.
The outer portion of the left wing of the Boeing 737, about 5,75 m, was severed. The ATR-42s left hand wing, outboard of the no.1 engine, was severed, along with the entire empennage.

Contributing Factors:
- Handling of two movements in the same area with different controllers on separate frequencies without proper coordination resulted in the lack of awareness to the controllers, pilots and towing car driver.
- The communication misunderstanding of the instruction to follow ID 7703 most likely contributed the towed aircraft enter the runway.
- The lighting environments in the tower cab and turning pad area of runway 24 might have diminished the capability to the controllers and pilots to recognize the towed aircraft that was installed with insufficient lightings.

A safe landing was made back at Toulouse. An investigation has been opened by the BEA.

The aircraft was destined for Japan Air Commuter (JA09JC), but still operating with its test registration.

Causes of the event (translated from French):
The untimely and prolonged drop in oil pressure in each of the engines is due to a buildup of oil in each propeller gearbox. This oil buildup is caused by a change in the definition of the gearboxes, including a change in the gap between the gears and the gearbox housing, introduced in 2018, beginning with engine number ED1715, and associated with an extended microgravity maneuver. The gap between the gear and its housing can lead to changes in oil characteristics.
PWC's assessment of the impact of the 2018 gearbox production changes was limited in depth.
The test maneuver usually referred to as ""zero g"" is actually a maintained microgravity maneuver. Although it was a contributing factor to the event, the maneuver performed was in accordance with
expected.
The manoeuvre requires important variations of attitude to put itself in the configuration allowing to test the systems. These conditions are favorable to the phenomenon of oil retention, linked to microgravity.

A cabin crew sustained fracture of the right ankle joint. The flight returned to Kagoshima with priority on ATC.


PROBABLE CAUSES
The JTSB concludes that the probable cause of this accident was that the Aircraft was suddenly shaken, therefore, the cabin attendant who was walking along the aisle fell off balance and injured.
It is probable that regarding the Aircraft was suddenly shaken was because the Aircraft attitude changed due to the nose-up pitch control by the flight crew members to avoid exceeding the VMO and the nose-up effects resulting from an increase in the Aircraft speed, following the encounter of localized changes in the wind direction and velocity.

The aircraft veered off the runway for 15 meters, and the nose landing gear was stuck in the mud, causing the ATR disabled. Three crew members and 18 passengers disembarked from the plane by door steps without injuries. The sole runway was closed until 23:10 LT. At the time of the incident, strong cross wind blew on the airport.

Cause
This serious incident occurred when the aircraft landed in a crosswind from the left, and immediately after landing, it deviated to the left.
It is presumed that the correction was delayed, causing the aircraft to deviate from the runway and come to a halt in the grass, rendering it unable to run on its own.

As the aircraft approached the assigned position, the pilot began braking per the instructions of the marshaller, but the brakes were not effective. The pilot instructed the copilot to brake, but these also did not respond effectively.
The aircraft was very close to the boarding bridge structure at position No. 5, and without braking ability, the left wing struck the structure, stopping the aircraft.
The crew shut down the engines and completed the procedures to secure the aircraft. The occupants exited the aircraft normally and without injury. The aircraft sustained significant damage. Additionally, boarding bridge No. 5 was damaged in its structure, motor, and movement system. No ground personnel were injured.

The investigation determined that the Serious Incident was caused by the following probable cause:
- Effective hydraulic pressure loss in the aircraft's braking system as it approached the parking position, a failure originating from abnormal operation of the ACW GEN, recorded in the GCU SN 1693, a unit responsible for regulating DC and AC voltage spikes and activating the hydraulic system for braking.

The following contributing factors were also identified:
- Inadequate practices by personnel responsible for aircraft maintenance, who did not provide adequate attention or follow-up to prior brake system failures reported by the crew.
- Absence of alerts and/or procedures in the operatorâ€™s and aircraft manufacturerâ€™s manuals to prevent the recurrence of brake system failures during taxiing, especially in confined taxiing areas.
- Insufficient control and verification by the aircraft manufacturer in response to repeated reports by operators of ATR 42-500 aircraft of failures in the brake systemâ€™s electrical system.

Marie Airport, ON (YAM/CYAM)","Sault Ste. Marie Airport, ON (YAM/CYAM)","The brand-new Dash-8 passenger plane departed Sault Ste. Marie Airport on an IFR flight plan. The chief pilot, sitting in the left seat, was giving routine recurrent training to the first officer who was flying from the right seat. About 40 minutes after takeoff, the DHC-8 returned to the Sault Ste. Marie Airport to practise instrument approaches. For the final practice approach on runway 11, the crew decided to carry out a flapless ILS approach with a full-stop landing. As the aircraft intercepted the localizer on the inbound leg, the captain simulated a right engine fire. The captain then lowered the gear normally and the approach was continued on the glide slope and localizer with the left engine torque set at 30 per cent and the right engine torque (simulated failed) set at about 16 per cent. Both pitch levers were advanced to produce 1050 rpm. About 150 feet above the ground, the aircraft made an abrupt uncommanded roll to the right and began to lose altitude. The first officer applied full power to the left engine, and the captain, sensing an increasing sink rate, applied power to the right engine as well. However, the aircraft continued to lose altitude rapidly, and it struck the snow-covered ground short of the runway in a 12-degree nose-up attitude, heading 128 degrees in a 24-degree right-wing-low attitude. The right wing tip hit the ground first, followed by the tail of the fuselage, the right main gear, and the right nacelle. The aircraft bounced about 15 feet and then touched down on the still intact left main gear. The nose gear broke off, and the aircraft bounced another 50 feet forward before sliding to a stop. The tail cone, nose gear and right propeller spinner were found along the wreckage trail. All four propeller blades from the right engine separated from the hub during the crash sequence.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The Canadian Aviation Safety Board (CASB) determined that the aircraft was flown in light to moderate icing conditions and accumulated significant airframe icing along the leading edge of the wings and horizontal stabilizer. The crew did not activate the de-icer boots on final approach and allowed the airspeed to decrease to the point where the aircraft departed from controlled flight and struck the ground.""

The same aircraft and crew were scheduled for a flight to Goose Bay the following morning. They parked the aircraft on the ramp and secured it for outside overnight parking. During the night there was precipitation, including snow, freezing rain, and rain accompanied by strong winds. The temperature varied around the freezing mark. At 10:12 the next day, the aircraft departed runway 29 on a scheduled IFR flight to Goose Bay. One minute and 19 seconds after take-off, while the aircraft was climbing through 1,800 feet asl in visual conditions, the right engine flamed out. The flight crew secured the engine and prepared for a right-hand visual approach to runway 29. Two minutes and 50 seconds after the right engine flamed out, the left engine flamed out. When the pilot turned the aircraft toward the airport, he assessed that the aircraft was beyond gliding distance from the closest runway and selected a nearby frozen lake as an alternate landing site. Five seconds after it had flamed out, the left engine re-lit and, in the following 17 seconds, returned to near full power. The pilot then decided to complete a visual approach to runway 16, which was the closest suitable runway. After a successful single-engine landing, the aircraft was towed to the ramp.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The Canadian Aviation Safety Board determined that ice, which had accumulated in the engine intakes while the aircraft was parked overnight, was not detected during the pre-flight inspection. The ice broke free during climb-out and disrupted the airflow to the engines.""

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the improper installation of the high-pressure fuel filter cover that allowed a massive fuel leak and subsequent fire to occur in the right engine nacelle. The improper installation probably
occurred at the engine manufacturer; however, the failure of airline maintenance personnel to detect and correct the improper installation contributed to the accident. Also contributing to the accident was the loss of the right engine centre access panels from a fuel explosion that negated the fire suppression system and allowed hydraulic line burn-through that in turn caused a total loss of airplane control on the ground.""

Flight BKP125 left Bangkok-Don Muang International Airport at 09:58 UTC with IFR clearance to Koh Samui Airport at FL210. Samui Tower was contacted at 10:45 and the crew were told runway 17 was the active runway and that the weather was fair with rain southwest of the field. Wind was later reported at 030 deg/10 knots and the runway was changed to runway 35. On base leg for runway 35 the flight continued ahead instead of turning right for finals. A missed approach procedure was executed with flaps still fully extended and both pilots were confused about which way to go. Samui Tower instructed them to turn left because of a mountain on the right side. BKP 125 entered an area of heavy rain and rolled to the left. Both pilots were disoriented as the aircraft continued to descend in a left wing down attitude. The aircraft eventually impacted into a coconut plantation at a 147 knots speed, 36deg nose-down and 75deg left roll.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot experienced spatial disorientation which resulted in improper control of the aircraft. Factors which contributed to accident were as follows: (1) The pilot flew the aircraft into bad weather condition which had very little or no visual reference; (2) Channelized attention occurred when all of the pilots concentration were focused on looking for the airport and neglecting to do proper cross checking or monitoring the aircraft attitude; (3) Confusion of pilots, poor teamwork or poor cockpit co-ordination in monitoring the flight instruments might contribute to loss of situational awareness and improper control of the aircraft through their false senses."""

Both aircraft were operating in accordance with instrument flight rules and were being provided with radar vectors for their respective approaches. The aircraft, while on their assigned headings, conflicted one mile southeast of the final approach path of runway 24 Left.

The Transportation Safety Board of Canada determined that the cause of the risk of collision was the untimely takeover of communications at the arrival position by the instructor and the untimely opening of the low-arrival position to relieve the arrival position of excess workload. The absence of procedures, general guidelines, and supervisor training concerning the opening/closing of control positions and the management of control staff likely contributed to this occurrence.

At 08:17 Ansett New Zealand Flight 703 departed Auckland (AKL) as scheduled bound for Palmerston North (PMR).
To the north of Palmerston North the pilots briefed themselves for a VOR/DME approach to runway 07 which was the approach they preferred. Subsequently Air Traffic Control specified the VOR/DME approach for runway 25, due to departing traffic, and the pilots re-briefed for that instrument approach. The IMC involved flying in and out of stratiform cloud, but continuous cloud prevailed during most of the approach. The aircraft was flown accurately to join the 14 nm DME arc and thence turned right and intercepted the final approach track of 250Â° M to the Palmerston North VOR. During the right turn, to intercept the inbound approach track, the aircraft's power levers were retarded to 'flight idle' and shortly afterwards the first officer advised the captain "".... 12 DME looking for 4000 (feet)"". The final approach track was intercepted at approximately 13 DME and 4700 feet, and the first officer advised Ohakea Control ""Ansett 703"" was ""established inbound"". Just prior to 12 miles DME the captain called ""Gear down"". The first officer asked him to repeat what he had said and then responded ""OK selected and on profile, ten - sorry hang on 10 DME we're looking for four thousand aren't we so - a fraction low"". The captain responded, ""Check, and Flap 15"". This was not acknowledged but the first officer said, ""Actually no, we're not, ten DME we're..... (The captain whistled at this point) look at that"". The captain had noticed that the right hand main gear had not locked down: ""I don't want that."" and the first officer responded, ""No, that's not good is it, so she's not locked, so Alternate Landing Gear...?"" The captain acknowledged, ""Alternate extension, you want to grab the QRH?"" After the First Officer's ""Yes"", the captain continued, ""You want to whip through that one, see if we can get it out of the way before it's too late."" The captain then stated, ""I'll keep an eye on the airplane while you're doing that.""
The first officer located the appropriate ""Landing Gear Malfunction Alternate Gear Extension"" checklist in Ansett New Zealand's Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) and began reading it. He started with the first check on the list but the captain told him to skip through some checks. The first officer responded to this instruction and resumed reading and carrying out the necessary actions. It was the operator's policy that all items on the QRH checklists be actioned, or
proceeded through, as directed by the captain. The first officer started carrying out the checklist. The captain in between advised him to pull the Main Gear Release Handle. Then the GPWS's audio alarm sounded. Almost five seconds later the aircraft collided with terrain. The Dash 8 collided with the upper slope of a low range of hills.

CAUSAL FACTORS: ""The captain not ensuring the aircraft intercepted and maintained the approach profile during the conduct of the non-precision instrument approach, the captain's perseverance with his decision to get the undercarriage lowered without discontinuing the instrument approach, the captain's distraction from the primary task of flying the aircraft safely during the first officer's endeavours to correct an undercarriage malfunction, the first officer not executing a Quick Reference Handbook procedure in the correct sequence, and the shortness of the ground proximity warning system warning.""

The bird impacted the leading edge at the root of the left wing. The wing-to-fuselage fairing was punctured and the forward wing spar and the electrical components attached to the spar were damaged. The left engine instrumentation failed and the master caution panel indicated multiple systems failures. The crew shut down the left engine 2 minutes and 9 seconds after the bird strike when the aircraft was passing through 1,860 feet at a speed of 220 knots. The left main landing gear unsafe warning light illuminated when the landing gear was extended. The crew discontinued the landing approach and elected to hold between 5 NM and 10 NM north-west of the aerodrome while they checked the aircraft systems. Thirty-seven minutes after the bird strike, the aircraft was landed on runway 10. During the
latter part of the landing roll, the pilot in command was unable to maintain directional control through the nosewheel steering. He attempted to slow the aircraft using reverse thrust on the right engine and the normal brakes, but the brakes failed. The aircraft veered off the sealed runway to the right before the pilot stopped it, using the emergency brake system.

SIGNIFICANT FACTORS:
1. The aircraft struck a 10 kg wedge-tailed eagle.
2. The left engine instrumentation failed and the master caution panel indicated multiple system failures.
3. System redundancy was compromised when the wiring was damaged, resulting in the failure of the left weight-on-wheels signal to the proximity switch electronic unit.
4. The nosewheel steering, anti-skid and normal braking, and ground spoiler deployment systems were rendered inoperative.
5. The crew did not follow company procedures by not using checklists to resolve non-normal situations.

These were carried out in Broome to repair damage resulting from a birdstrike which occurred in May 1996. The crew for the flight comprised two experienced pilots, one of whom was a qualified test pilot, and a flight test engineer. There were no passengers. When the landing gear was selected up, after takeoff, the nose landing gear door unsafe and landing gear handle lights remained on. The gear was selected down and safe indications were obtained. The gear was selected up a second time and it retracted normally. The test flight was continued, with sequences being completed up to the landing gear tests. Landing gear down selection resulted in a safe indication on the main gear (two green lights) and unsafe indications on the nose gear (a red gear light, no amber door light and a light in the gear handle). Actions were completed in accordance with the abnormal and emergency checklist however, the nose gear continued to indicate unsafe.
An inspection by ground engineers, during a fly-past, determined that the nose gear was still retracted but the gear doors were partially open. Positive-gravity manoeuvres and a touch-and-go landing failed to shake the nose gear free. The crew decided to land at Broome once all other traffic was clear and emergency services were in place.
Advice from the manufacturer's representative in Broome indicated that the propellers would remain clear of the runway during the landing. A landing was completed with the aircraft sliding to a stop on its main wheels and nose, 460 m after touchdown.

It is probable that motivation, pressure and fatigue were the main factors in the decision not to complete the maintenance control manual requirements prior to manufacturing the replacement cover plate. It is likely that the maintenance engineers allowed their desire to get the job done to overcome any caution developed through experience. Limited time availability meant that ordering a replacement part, or ensuring the completion of the required design and approval process, would prevent them meeting the deadline. Fatigue may have reduced the maintenance engineer's analytical ability and possibly contributed to the flawed decision.
The lack of a project manager to supervise and audit the complete engineering process meant there was no safety net to prevent incorrect decisions or practices, emanating from the workface, having a detrimental affect on safety. The lack of a project manager and the limited presence of the technical manager also meant there was no one of authority that the maintenance engineers could readily discuss the problem with before they made their final decision.
The fact that the cover plate was not a structural component and was only a protective cover probably misled the maintenance engineers into believing that the manufacture of a similar, but not exact, replacement part would not significantly affect safety.
The ultimate safety net, landing gear retraction tests, failed when the cover plate was not fitted prior to the tests. The plate was not fitted because it was not seen as a significant part of the landing gear system and time pressure probably led maintenance personnel to believe that the tests could not wait until assembly was complete.

The crew actuated the alternate gear extension system and was unable to extend the right main landing gear. The first officer pulled the main landing gear alternate extension cable until it stopped and the right main landing gear uplock actuator did not release. On advice from company maintenance, after completing the alternate gear extension procedure, the crew retracted the nose gear and the left main gear using the normal system and then attempted another normal extension. Only the left main landing gear extended. The airplane's number 2 hydraulic system was depleted with 1.5 quarts of fluid remaining. The crew attempted another retraction to raise the left main landing gear without success. The captain then landed the airplane with only the left main landing gear extended. Examination of the alternate gear system revealed the main gear extension cable would bind after the left main landing gear uplock actuator would release. Subsequent testing of the system while the airplane was on jack stands reduced the binding, but in all tests the left main landing gear uplock actuator would release before the right uplock actuator. Examination of the main landing gear alternate extension cable revealed the plastic coating was missing in two places adjacent to a pulley. The right main landing gear wheel well was excessively dirty with areas of exfoliated white paint, exposing the underlying primer.

Probable Cause: A failure of the normal landing gear extension system due to a hydraulic leak, and the failure of the airplane's emergency landing gear extension system due to inadequate servicing by company maintenance personnel. Factors were the emergency landing gear extension systems dirty and binding condition, a worn emergency landing gear extension cable, and the training simulator's lack of fidelity concerning the force required to operate the emergency gear extension T-handle.

He noted no warning lights or horns before or during the event. He applied right control wheel and right rudder to stop the left roll. After the captain had the airplane's roll stabilized, he 'made a wide left pattern and returned to the departure airport.' The airplane was landed without further incident. A postincident inspection of the airplane revealed that the left inboard roll spoiler was 'jammed and partially deployed.' An examination and disassembly of the roll spoiler servoactuator revealed that a plug (PN A50993-1), which had been fusion-welded into the base of the piston (PN A50992-1), had separated and lodged between the base of the piston and the shims, restricting the piston's movement. Dowty Aerospace (the manufacturer) had recorded six previous failures of fusion welds in pistons on DHC-8 roll spoiler servoactuators before this incident.

Probable Cause: a fractured fusion weld in the piston of the roll spoiler servoactuator, which allowed the plug at the base of the piston to separate and jam the piston. A factor relating to the incident was: the inadequate design of the airplane's roll spoiler servoactuator piston.

During the taxi, a ground marshaller signaled for the airplane to be turned (left) toward the northwest. The flight crew initiated a left turn. During the turn, the right wing tip of the airplane collided with a wing deicing cart. The cart tumbled and bounced back toward the trailing edge of the right wing. A portion of the cart impaled the right aileron, causing substantial damage. The captain and first officer did not see the deice cart in time to stop the right wing from striking it during the turn. Subsequent investigation revealed that the marshaller was using a spot on the ramp to park the accident airplane that was intended to be used for a smaller aircraft. Also, the ramp area at the airport did not have any lead-in lines or markings to provide taxi guidance, nor was a 'safe movement' zone designated. Additionally, the decing cart had been noted as a potential hazard by the previous station manager; however, it was not moved because of its needed proximity to an electrical source.

Probable Cause: failure of the ground marshaller to marshal the airplane into a correct parking place on the ramp, her failure to verify clearance between the right wing of the airplane and the ground de-ice cart, and failure of the flight crew to ensure clearance of the right wing as the airplane was being taxied into the parking place. Factors relating to the accident include: a congested ramp facility, and inadequate ramp markings.

During climb-out, the flight crew had been cleared to maintain an altitude of 14 000 feet above sea level (asl). During climb, the aircraft was under manual control by the first officer. At about 12 000 asl, he noticed that the elevator controls were jammed. The pilot-in-command took the aircraft's controls, also found the elevators jammed, and noted that the elevator trim was at the nose-down limit. He tried to disconnect the left and right elevators by using the pitch disconnect handle as prescribed by the aircraft's flight manual, but without success. He reset the pitch disconnect system. He then engaged the autopilot, which disengaged automatically a few seconds later. The flight crew decided to turn back to Jean Lesage Airport and requested emergency services on the scene. Elevator trim and engine power were used to control the aircraft until landing, which proceeded without further incident. While taxiing, the pilot-in-command checked the elevator controls and found them to be working normally.

Immediately after take-off the first officer, who was the pilot flying, noticed excessive back pressure on the control column and unusually excessive pitch-up attitude. He trimmed the aircraft to counteract the back pressure, but even after moving the elevator trim control wheel to the full nose-down position the problem was still there. He informed the captain of the situation and the captain took control of the aircraft. The captain found that the elevator trim control wheel was jammed in the full nose-down position and, after levelling at 5,000 feet, he applied a heavy force to the trim control wheel to free it. Coincident with the freeing of the trim control the aircraft made a sudden nose-down pitching movement and the control column force returned to normal. The flight crew advised the Gander area control centre (ACC) of the situation and were given priority for a return to St. John's. The aircraft landed at St. John's at 0739 without further incident.

As a result, a logbook entry was made, and inspection of the airplane revealed damage due to contact between the elevator and rudder. Examination of the elevator gust lock mechanism revealed that only three of four elevator stop bumpers were installed. The upper right bumper was missing, but the mount bolt was still in place. The upper left bumper was cracked, chipped, crazed, and displayed a longitudinal crack that ran its entire length. FDR data showed that when the airplane taxied onto the departure runway for the previous flight, the gust lock was released, and rapid deflection of the elevator control surfaces and the control yoke was noted. At the point where the control yoke returned to its nominal position, the LH and RH elevator graph lines were approximately 4 degrees apart. These lines remained separated by approximately 4 degrees throughout the remainder of the flight. Examination of prior flights revealed the elevator control surface graph lines were superimposed in all modes of flight. Winds at the departure airport were from 300 degrees at 22 knots, gusting to 27 knots. A product safety representative for the airplane manufacturer 'guaranteed' the airplane would have been undamaged during the rapid elevator deflection, had the elevator stop bumpers been installed.

Probable Cause: the missing elevator stop bumper that resulted in elevator over-travel and damage to the elevator. A factor in the incident was the abrupt release of the elevator control lock in windy conditions.

The flight was in the process of being boarded by twenty-five passengers for a regularly scheduled flight to London (CYXU). The aircraft was approached by a company tow tractor which failed to stop before making contact with the nose of the stationary aircraft. The impact caused a ten centimetre hole on the right side of the aircraft´s nose cone. The aircraft was taken out of service for repair.

An engine examination and teardown determined that the #5 bearing assembly had failed. Additional examination ascertained that the P2.5/P3 switching valve to rear inlet case sealing air tube had become disconnected, and the NL probe port sealing tube had melted, allowing an oil fed fire outside of the engine casing and into the engine compartment. Investigation determined that the engine had not been placed on oil consumption and daily chip detector examination by company maintenance as required by the engine maintenance manual following a loss of oil event approximately 180 hours previous to the fire. Additionally, the mandatory implementation of P&W service bulletin 20914, which addressed the P2.5/P3 switching valve to rear inlet case sealing air tube and NL probe port sealing tube was not carried out by the company, nor was it required, as the FAA airworthiness directive making the service bulletin mandatory did not include the PW120A engine. The investigation also revealed that the company mandated implementation of P&W service bulletin 21446R3, was not carried out during an earlier hot section inspection and immediately preceding the earlier oil loss event.

Probable Cause: The failure of the number 5 engine bearing assembly followed by the disconnection of the P2.5/P3 switching valve to rear inlet case sealing air tube and the melting of the NL probe port (sealing tube) which allowed an oil fed fire beyond the constraints of the engine casing and into the engine nacelle. A contributing factor was the company's failure to follow several maintenance procedures within the maintenance manual after a previous oil loss event. A second factor was the omission of the PW120A engine from the airworthiness directive issued by the FAA which mandated the completion of Pratt & Whitney service bulletin 20914. The lack of inclusion of the PW120A engine in the AD resulted in the company's correct interpretation that the service bulletin was not mandatory.

The airplane was taxiing for departure from Washington Ronald Reagan National Airport (DCA) for White Plains, New York. It was the employee's first day working at DCA and his first day back at work from extended leave.

The information collected during the investigation of this accident indicates that the ramp agent had both training and experience in working near propeller-driven airplanes and that the carelessness shown in the accident was inadvertent and out of character. This finding is substantiated by statements from coworkers, who described the ramp agent as safety conscious and a hard worker. The surface of the ramp was not a factor in this accident. The ramp agent was at the end of his shift on a very hot day and was taking a medication for a medical condition that had the potential to impair his judgment.

Probable Cause: The ramp agent's impaired performance due to his hyperthyroidism, which was exacerbated by the heat and was inadequately controlled by medication, and possibly also due to the use of an antianxiety medication.

After assessing the situation, the captain elected to continue the climb. Shortly after level off, the crew noted that the stiffness increased proportionally with airspeed. This was also noted during the descent phase of the flight, specifically, the first officer stated the resistance increased for left roll inputs as the aircraft accelerated. The captain reported that they attempted to relieve the pressure with aileron trim, however, when the trim indicator reached the first index on the indicator, the control wheel ""snapped"" approximately 25 degrees and the airplane banked to the right. The crew reported that as the airplane slowed, while on approach, the roll control stiffness decreased. After landing, the crew accomplished a full control check and noted no abnormal indications with the ailerons or spoilers. Post flight inspection disclosed a number of discrepancies that are believed to have contributed to the stiff flight controls. The items are as follows: the right control yoke chain tension was high; the right aileron spring tab hinge bearing did not rotate freely; the left aileron spring tab aft spring tension was low and the contact stud was worn; the right aileron spring tab tension was low and the contact stud was worn; the left aileron hinge bearing did not rotate freely.


Probable Cause: Improper tension of the right control yoke chain; a worn right aileron spring tab hinge bearing; improper tension of the left aileron spring tab aft spring and worn contact stud; improper tension of the right aileron spring tab and a worn contact stud; a worn left aileron hinge bearing.

On board the aircraft, a DHC-8-103 with registration LN-WIK, were a crew of two pilots and one cabin attendant, 26 passengers and one passive cabin attendant.
During the approach to Hammerfest the crew was informed about variable and occasional gusty wind from south-east. The wind direction favoured runway 23 and the crew planned the landing accordingly. The copilot was Pilot Flying (PF) and the commander was Pilot Not Flying (PNF). The copilot was newly hired and was flying under supervision. The crew was kept updated on the wind conditions by the AFIS operator, and at times the gusty wind conditions favoured runway 05. The copilot left the control to the commander who continued the approach to runway 05. Just before landing the wind direction veered to the right and increased in strength, resulting in a significant tail wind component. This resulted in a marked increase in the descent rate which the commander tried to stop by advancing to full power. However, the altitude was too low and the airplane touched down hard just inside the runway edge on runway 05. At touch down the right main landing gear leg failed. The airplane slid on the belly, right partly retracted main wheel and wing tip for some 650 m, and stopped just after the second (TWY B) turnoff to the apron. The fire and rescue vehicles were quickly at the scene and sprayed foam on the plane to prevent fire. The cabin attendant calmed the passengers who wanted to get out of the plane quickly due to smoke and burned smell in the cabin. It took 33 seconds from the commander's order to evacuate until this was actually initiated. The delay was mainly caused by the fact that the order did not get through the cabinÂ’s Public Address (PA) system.
The investigations show that WiderÃ¸e permitted landings in up to the maximum demonstrated cross wind component of 36 kt and in up to 10 kt tail wind during short field operations.

Hawaii Island Air, d.b.a. Island Air, was operating the airplane as a positioning flight under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91. The airline transport pilot licensed captain, first officer, one flight attendant, and two deadheading pilot crew members were not injured; one deadheading pilot sustained serious injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The cross-country repositioning flight departed Honolulu, Hawaii, about 1515, with a planned destination of Kahului, Hawaii. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan had been filed. The approximate global positioning system (GPS) coordinates of the event were 21 degrees 09.02 minutes north latitude and 157 degrees 05.8 minutes west longitude.The airplane encountered severe turbulence during an en route descent and a captain who was deadheading was not secured in his seat and received serious injuries. The airplane was being positioned to another airport, and had a deadheading flight crew on board. Prior to the descent, the captain noted an airspeed anomaly for the existing power setting. He also observed that the flap indicator showed a ""slight"" deployment of the flaps. He requested that the deadheading captain look out a cabin window, and verify the flap position. The deadheading captain reported to the flying captain that the flaps were in the fully retracted position. About this time, ATC personnel requested that a descent be initiated, which the flight crew initiated by reducing the power to slow down the airplane. As the deadheading captain was making his way back to his cabin seat, the airplane encountered severe turbulence, which lasted about 5 to 10 seconds. He was thrown about the cabin and injured. The flying captain declared an emergency. The flight landed without incident, and taxied to the gate where the injured crewmember was transported to the hospital. A review was conducted of the ATC air-ground recordings between Maui approach control (APCON), two other airplanes flying in the area, and the accident airplane (Moku 979). Prior to Moku 979 checking in with Maui approach, the two other airplanes reported moderate turbulence at 4,000 feet, and moderate to occasional severe turbulence between 2,000 and 2,500 feet. Both airplanes were about 15 miles east of Maui, in the general vicinity of the accident airplane. The controller contacted FSS, and advised them of the PIREP's. About 75 seconds later, Moku 979 reported in to the approach control. The controller told them to ""expect lower in 5 miles."" The controller did not advise Moku 979 of the reported turbulence in the area. Ninety-five seconds later the controller instructed Moku 979 to begin a descent to 1,500 feet. Fifteen seconds later Moku 979 declared an emergency and reported the injury.an in-flight encounter with clear air turbulence, which resulted in a serious injury to a deadheading crewmember."

Pearson International Airport, Ontario","North Bay Jack Garland Airport, Ontario","The Air Canada Jazz DHC-8-100 (registration C-GTBP, serial number 066) operating as flight JZA7779 departed Toronto/Lester B. Pearson International Airport, Ontario, under instrument flight rules for a regularly scheduled flight to North Bay, Ontario. The flight crew planned a stabilized constant descent angle non-precision approach to Runway 08 at the North Bay Jack Garland Airport. The aircraft touched down approximately 8900 feet past the threshold of Runway 08, which is 10 000 feet in length, and overran the end at 2348 Eastern Standard Time. The aircraft came to rest approximately 260 feet past the end of the runway in two to three feet of snow. There were no injuries and the aircraft sustained minor damage.


Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors

1. The approach speed of the aircraft was higher than outlined in the Air Canada Jazz standard operating procedures (SOPs). Because the aircraft could not be configured for landing until it slowed to the appropriate speed, commencement of the final descent to the minimum descent altitude (MDA) was delayed.
2. The final descent to the MDA was not initiated at the final approach fix (FAF). Therefore, even though the flight path angle (FPA) of the aircraft was about 3° and the rate of descent was constant, the aircraft was well above the desired vertical profile, resulting in the aircraft reaching the MDA well beyond the missed approach point (MAP).
3. The flight crew was not cognizant of the distance or time to the MAP during the approach. Therefore, the aircraft crossed the MAP before arriving at the MDA, but a missed approach was not conducted.
4. When the runway edge lights came into view, the flight crew continued the approach and began the landing sequence without being able to accurately assess the aircraft position and rate of change of position. This assessment may also have been hindered by a windrow obscuring the runway end lights.
5. Air Canada Jazz had not provided the flight crew members with adequate initial stabilized constant descent angle (SCDA) training, or any recurrent SCDA training and they were therefore unfamiliar with many aspects of SCDA approaches.
6. Transport Canada approved the Air Canada Jazz training program without data to indicate that the SCDA training met the requirements of the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs) and the Commercial Air Service Standards (CASS). This resulted in flight crews not receiving all the required training to safely conduct this type of approach.

During the return flight to Exeter the right engine suffered a significant oil leak and lost oil pressure, so the flight crew shut it down. Subsequently, the crew noticed the left engine also leaking oil, with a fluctuating oil pressure, so they initiated a diversion to Bristol, where they landed safely. The oil leaks were traced to damaged O-ring seals within the oil cooler fittings on both engines. Both oil coolers had been removed and refitted during the base maintenance check at Exeter. It was probably during re-installation that the O-ring seals were damaged. A number of factors led to this damage and to missed oil leak checks.


Conclusions
The oil leaks from both engines were caused by damaged O-ring seals at the oil cooler fittings. This damage probably occurred when both oil coolers were improperly re-installed by the same individual during base maintenance. The limited repair instructions had resulted in the unnecessary removal of the oil coolers and the re-installation of the coolers had not been identified as safety critical tasks. Following the oil cooler re-installation it was not documented that an oil leak check would be required, due to incomplete planning of the tasks on a ‘defect job card’. The incorrect diagnosis that the slow oil seepage from both engine nacelles was residual oil from a previous leak led to the source of the leaks not being fully investigated at East Midlands

The pilot in command was Pilot Not Flying (PNF) and acted as instructor, seated in the right cockpit seat. Pilot Flying (PF) was a captain candidate, seated in the left seat. The captain candidate had recently passed a skill test on the aircraft type and was on his third day with line training.
Before the approach to runway 03, the crew briefed each other about the company wind limits for landing at Stokka Airport, which permit maximum 15 kt wind speed within or into sector 060-150Â°. Because of high terrain east of the airport and based on experience with difficult landing conditions with wind down from the mountains, the company had established restrictive wind limitations. The AFIS unit gave information about the wind conditions three times and the wind speed was then within the company limits. The last wind information, given two minutes before landing, showed variable wind direction from the right side at 9-15 kt.
In a very short time the wind began gusting up to 17 kt. The AFIS officer was about to grab the microphone and inform flight 701, but this was too late because he saw the aircraft was about to touch down. At the same time as the radio altimeter announced 20 ft, the pilots experienced a significant increased descend. The captain candidate decided to do an aborted landing and was about to increase power, when the aircraft hit the ground.
The landing was heavy and the right main gear collapsed with the result that the aircraft settled down on its side. Despite this, the pilots managed to keep the aircraft on the runway. After the aircraft had come to a complete stop, an evacuation was initiated. No persons were injured.

CONCLUSION
a) In this accident AIBN concluded that the various operational and technical factors each were within the applicable limits. The combination of approach angle, limited experience on the aircraft and sudden wind change, meant that the plane had a hard landing.
b) The increase in wind occurred just before the plane landed and came so quickly that AFIS authority was unable to notify the change.
c) During the landing, the combination of vertical and horizontal forces on the right main landing gear exceeded the value for which the aircraft manufacturer designed the safety bolt (Fuse Pin) to break. This meant that the right main landing gear collapsed.

2 Dec 2010,de Havilland Canada DHC-8-103,LN-WIU,Widerøes Flyveselskap,0,near Helle-Svolvær Airport (ENSH),non,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/191575,Dash 8-100,DH8A,18:18,378,P&W Canada PW120,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 38,0,Serious incident,Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,BodÃ¸ Airport (ENBO),Helle-SvolvÃ¦r Airport (ENSH),"WiderÃ¸e flight WF814 was a domestic service from BodÃ¸ to Helle in Norway and operated in the hours of darkness.
The aircraft, a DHC-8-100, was on approach to Helle when it suddenly had a significant loss of both speed and altitude. The flight crew regained control, but the airplane came very low (83 ft (25 m) above ground). During the recovery the airplane was exposed to high g-force and the engine torque limits were exceeded. The crew aborted the approach and continued to Leknes Airport where a normal landing was performed.

The AIBN investigation indicates that the airplane at low altitude was exposed to significant wind shear (microburst), probably from a Cumulonimbus cloud (CB) in the area.

The Accident Investigation Board has, as part of this investigation, in particular focused on risk management and safety margins in connection with circling approaches in darkness. No obvious systemic failures or other deficiencies that could have influenced on the chain of events or causal factors was identified.

At one point during the chain of events, the First Officer took over the flight controls. The Commander did not oppose this. Apart from agreeing that this happened, the crew has given, in part, different descriptions of the chain of events. Based on the available facts, the Accident Investigation Board has not been able to determine neither which pilot did what, exactly when, and in which order, nor the effects of each action, seen in isolation. It has therefore not been possible to draw any solid conclusions about the significance of the actions of the first officer. The collective actions of the crew did, however, most likely lead to a recovery that was initiated in time to prevent the airplane from colliding with the ground.

The maneuvering to regain control was executed with sparse visual references and without a visible horizon. This investigation has revealed that the Commander was exposed to conditions that could provoke a somatogravic illusion. The Accident Investigation Board has, however, not found evidence to conclude that a spatial disorientation, if any, did have any effect on the Commanders handling of the wind shear.

This incident is an important reminder of the vulnerability connected to maneuvering low above the terrain with sparse visual references in darkness and turbulent air. It is also a reminder of the fact that operators and pilots with thorough knowledge of local conditions, experience and training beyond the regulatory minimum standards would be more capable of handling critical situations like this.

All 31 passengers and three crew members survived. The airplane operated on a flight from ReykjavÃ­k Domestic Airport (RKV), Iceland to GodthÃ¥b/Nuuk Airport (GOH), Greenland with an enroute stop at Kulusuk.
At 12:58, the flight crew of TF-JMB made radio contact with Nuuk AFIS and were informed that the runway in use was 23.
The weather was reported to be: wind direction from 170Â° at a speed of 24 kts with a maximum of 43 kts, the visibility was 4,000 meters in light snow, moderate blowing snow, a few clouds at 1,800 feet, broken clouds at 3,500 feet, the temperature was zero, the dew point was minus four Celsius and the QNH was 1014 hPa.
The flight crew made visual contact with the runway and decided to deviate to the right (west) of the offset Localizer (LLZ) to runway 23. The flight continued towards the runway from a position right of the runway centerline. The flight crew was aiming to land the aircraft at a point between the runway threshold and the touchdown zone.
As the aircraft approached runway 23 it was still in the final right turn over the landing threshold.
The aircraft touched down on runway 23 between the runway threshold and the touchdown zone and to the left of the runway centerline. The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) data indicated that the aircraft was banking more than 11Â° to the right as the aircraft touched down. At the same time the vertical acceleration was approximately 3.9 G and the rate of descent was greater than 13 feet per second.
The right main landing gear (MLG) shock strut fuse pin sheared and the right MLG collapsed, the aircraft skidded down the runway and departed the runway to the right.
The nose landing gear was separated from the aircraft as the aircraft was entering the unpaved surface. The aircraft came to rest in the rocky area to the right of runway 23.

Adverse wind and turbulence conditions at BGGH led to flight crew task saturation on final approach and a breakdown of optimum cockpit resource management (CRM) resulting in a divergence from the operatorÂ’s stabilized approach policy.
The divergence from the operatorÂ’s stabilized approach policy caused an unstabilized approach and a hard landing leading to an excess load of the right MLG at touchdown.
According to its design, the right MLG fuse pin sheared as a result of stress

13 Oct 2011,de Havilland Canada DHC-8-102,P2-MCJ,Airlines PNG,28,20 km S of Madang Airport (MAG),w/o,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/321035,Dash 8-100,DH8A,17:17,125,P&W Canada PW121,Fatalities: 28 / Occupants: 32,0,Accident,En route,Passenger - Scheduled,Lae-Nadzab Airport (LAE/AYNZ),Madang Airport (MAG/AYMD),"Airlines PNG flight 1600, a DHC-8-100, crashed during the descent towards Madang, Papua New Guinea, killing 28 occupants; 4 survived the accident.

The airplane operated on Airlines PNG flight CG-1600 from Port Moresby (POM) to Madang (MAG) via Lae-Nadzab (LAE). The aircraft departed Lae at 16:47 and climbed to FL160 en route to Madang. The flight progressed normally and the flight was transferred to Madang Air Traffic Control (ATC) at 17:10. The descent profile on this sector was steep because of the proximity of the Finisterre Ranges to Madang and the pilot-in-command (PIC), who was the handling pilot, was hand-flying the aircraft because the autopilot was unserviceable. At 17:12, in response to a request from Madang Tower, the flight crew stated the aircraft was 24 NM from Madang, leaving 13,000 feet on descent. The pilot-in-command conducted a low power, steep descent with the propellers set at 900 revolutions per minute (RPM) in an attempt to get below cloud in order to be able to see across the ocean to Madang. Neither pilot noticed the aircraft's speed increasing to its maximum operating speed; when this speed was reached, a warning sounded in the cockpit.
The pilot-in-command pulled the power levers backwards, through the flight idle gate and into the ground beta range. Moments later, at 10,090 feet, both propellers oversped simultaneously and exceeded their maximum permitted revolutions per minute (rpm) by in excess of 60 percent.
The overspeeding propellers back-drove the turbines in the engines (instead of the engine turbines driving the propellers) and this caused severe damage to the left engine. The right engine was not as badly damaged; its propeller feathered due to a system malfunction so that the propeller was no longer back-driving the turbine. It was not possible, however, for the pilots to unfeather the right propeller and generate useable thrust from the right engine, which meant that a forced landing without power was inevitable.
Use of the landing gear and flaps was not considered by the pilots, and they were not extended, although the flaps could have been extended until the engines were shut down before impact and the landing gear could have been extended at any time. If the landing gear and flaps had been extended, the impact could have been less severe.

The aircraft thus force-landed gear-up on sparsely timbered terrain on the northern side of the Buang River, 33 km south east of Madang township. During the impact sequence, it was severely damaged while colliding with trees and the ground, and an intense fuel-fed fire began.
Villagers who had heard and witnessed the aircraft in the final stages of its descent proceeded to the crash site to find the fuselage severely disrupted and engulfed in flames. They assisted the four survivors and took them to the nearest first-aid post.

Contributing safety factors:
- The Pilot-in-Command moved the power levers rearwards below the flight idle gate shortly after the VMO overspeed warning sounded. This means that the release triggers were lifted during the throttle movement.
- The power levers were moved further behind the flight idle gate leading to ground beta operation in flight, loss of propeller speed control, double propeller overspeed, and loss of usable forward thrust, necessitating an off-field landing.
- A significant number of DHC-8-100, -200, and -300 series aircraft worldwide did not have a means of preventing movement of the power levers below the flight idle gate in flight, or a means to prevent such movement resulting in a loss of propeller speed control.

As they taxied, a ground crewmember stood by the wing to ensure the airplane’s clearance from another airline’s equipment and signaled thumbs up to the flight crew to indicate when they were clear of the equipment. After taxiing a short distance, the flight crew stopped and awaited further instructions from a ramp agent on the radio for positioning the airplane. Unknown to the flight crew, the deicing team misunderstood the thumbs-up signal to mean that deicing could begin. Consequently, they moved into a position behind the airplane’s left wing and in front of the left horizontal tail. The ramp agent working the radio could not see the airplane from the radio location and, believing it was still at the gate, instructed the flight crew to taxi 50 feet and stop for deicing. The flight crew initiated taxiing and almost immediately felt a bump, colliding with the boom arm of the deice truck. They then stopped the airplane. The deice truck was not equipped for radio communication; therefore, the team’s movement and position could not be coordinated with the other ground personnel or flight crew.
Probable Cause: The inadequate communication among ground crew personnel, which resulted in the airplane’s collision with a deice truck.

Additionally, company records showed that both pilots had completed Era Aviation's training with no issues or discrepancies.

The NTSB's review of recent activities and work schedules, company records, postincident pilot interviews, and toxicology reports revealed no evidence that fatigue or any pre-existing medical or behavioral conditions or drugs or alcohol adversely affected the pilots' performance during the incident flight.

The CVRs installed on Era Aviation's airplanes at the time of the incident did not comply with current federal regulations, and the FAA was not aware of this. Although the lack of a CVR capable of recording 2Â hours of data was not a factor related to the cause of this incident, it did affect the NTSB's ability to evaluate the pilot's actions during the loss of control and to determine whether the stick shaker activated.

Pilots' Response to the Stall Event

During the climb to 10,000 feet, FDR data show that the flight maintained about 90 percent torque and 150 knots, which was consistent with company procedures. The captain stated that the airplane encountered icing conditions between about 7,000 and 8,000 feet, at which time, he turned on all of the deicing equipment, which both flight crewmembers stated was working properly. When the captain leveled the airplane at 10,000 feet, the planned cruise altitude, he reduced power from a climb setting of 90 percent of maximum torque to about 70 percent of maximum torque. At the time, the IAS was 170Â knots. Shortly thereafter, the flight crew requested and received a clearance from ATC to maintain a block altitude of 10,000 to 14,000 feet to avoid continued icing conditions.

The captain stated that he did not adjust the power when he began the climb, which FDR data confirmed. The captain believed he engaged the IAS mode of the autopilot when he began the climb; however, if the captain had used the IAS mode at the reduced power setting, the airplane would likely not have climbed. Both pilots stated in interviews that climbing in the VS mode if the autopilot was engaged was not recommended and that they did not recall selecting the autopilot VS mode. Specifically, the Era Aviation FOTP stated that the VS mode should not be used for sustained climb if the autopilot was engaged since the airspeed was not protected and a stall may occur, but that it may be used to establish initial climb pitch attitude. Despite this guidance and the flight crew's apparent awareness of it, data showed that the flight began a steady climb of 850 feet per minute, which was consistent with the captain selecting the VS mode.

Because the airplane began to climb steadily without the addition of power, the pitch attitude began to increase, and the indicated airspeed began to decrease. Recorded data showed that, over the same interval, the airplane pitch attitude increased from 3Â°Â airplane nose up at 10,000 feet to 14Â° airplane nose up at 12,000 feet and that the airspeed decreased from 170 to 103 knots, the speed at which the airplane stalled.

As noted previously, in addition to airspeed indicators, orange speed control indicators providing fast/slow indications were installed in the captain's and first officer's ADIs on the instrument panel directly in front of both pilots. The speed control indicators depicted airspeed relative to 1.3 Vstall and would have moved into the ""slow"" region of the indicator as the airspeed dropped below about 116 knots. Given that the pitch attitude is a primary control indication and airspeed is a primary performance indication, both pilots (PF and PM) should have been cross checking (that is, continuously and logically observing the instruments for attitude and performance information) both indications frequently. However, both pilots reported that they were not aware of the changes in pitch attitude or airspeed.

The captain stated that, during the climb out of 10,000 feet, he was monitoring the icing situation outside the airplane.Â  He described the icing conditions as ""the high end of moderate"" and he stated they needed to avoid those conditions to continue the flight. When the airplane began to break out of the clouds at an altitude about 11,500 feet, the captain decided to level off at 12,000 feet, and he began monitoring the autopilot as it captured that altitude. He stated that he thought the airspeed was 150 to 160 knots, but he did not recall looking at the airspeed indicator or the fast-slow indication on the ADI.Â 

The first officer stated that normally the PF would specify the climb speed, but he did not recall if the captain did so and he could not remember what the airspeed was in the climb. He said he was busy taking care of paperwork and charts, preparing to communicate with the destination station, looking outside, focusing on the icing conditions, making sure the de-ice boots were inflating, and seeing whether the airplane was shedding ice or not. As the PM, the first officer was responsible for watching the primary instrument indications and ensuring that the airplane was maintaining the appropriate climb airspeed. However, he stated that he could not recall what the indications were on the instrument panel before the stall but that he thought that the airspeed was about 150Â knots before the upset.

The pilots allowed the airspeed to drop to stall speed because the captain failed to set climb power when he inappropriately selected the autopilot VS mode for climb and both pilots were preoccupied with other duties and were not watching their airspeed or attitude indicators during the climb.

As the airplane began to level off at 12,000 feet, the airplane began to shudder. The flight crew stated that they attributed the shudder to an unbalanced condition of the propellers due to uneven ice shedding. Both pilots stated that they had experienced similar ice shedding on their previous flight, and neither pilot associated the vibrations they felt as the approach to an aerodynamic stall. FDR data indicate that the airplane was experiencing an aerodynamic prestall buffet; however, neither pilot recognized the buffet as an indication that the airplane was about to stall.

No recorded data were available to confirm a stall warning, but, according to the pilots, the stick shaker did not activate at the time the airplane began to lose lift, which according to FDR data and the airplane performance study, occurred at 1041:18 as the airplane was climbing through 12,192Â feet at 103 knots. The FDR data showed the control column moving aft from 3Â° to 8.5Â° beginning at the time of the loss of lift consistent with autopilot control. This was followed by autopilot disconnection and continued rapid aft movement of the control column to 33Â° within the next 3 seconds. Aerodynamic stall recovery requires the pilot to reduce the airplane's AOA by pushing the nose down so that proper air flow across the wing and control surfaces can be restored. Therefore, the captain's aft movement of the control column was an inappropriate response to the stall and impeded its recovery.

The FDR also showed that the airplane began a left roll 5 seconds after the initial loss of lift and that the roll coincided with the autopilot disconnection. Following the left roll, pitch decreased from 20Â° nose up to 37Â° nose down. The captain stated that he attempted to control the airplane by rolling it to wings level and pulling nose up, but he was unable to regain control. FDR data indicated that the captain held the control column aft to more than 33? for 16 seconds during the descent and that he did not attempt to push the nose over for another 7 seconds after releasing back pressure.

The captain stated that, during the descent, he made a combination of control and power inputs, pushing the yoke and power forward and back. The captain's statements were confirmed by FDR data. Following the initial roll, engine torque on both engines decreased to about 30Â percent, and subsequently increased to over 100 percent twice, exceeding the torque limitations on the engines. The captain stated he did not recall seeing any speed during the event as he ""never once"" looked at the airspeed indicator. As the airspeed increased above 160 knots during the descent, pitch began to increase, and the airplane leveled off at an altitude of about 7,072 feet.

Era Aviation's stall recovery procedure stated that the first action was to start recovery at the earliest warning (stick shaker). However, as noted, the captain stated that he did not think the stick shaker had activated and that, at the time, he did not realize they were experiencing an aerodynamic stall.

The second action listed in the stall recovery procedure was to advance the power levers and call ""max power."" However, the captain initially reduced power, and, only later, as the airplane was descending, did he advance the power to maximum. Once the airplane was fully stalled and descending, the addition of maximum power without also reducing the AOA was not effective in the stall recovery.

The third action listed in the stall recovery procedure was to reduce back pressure to stop the shaker and minimize altitude loss; however, the captain did not reduce back pressure. Rather, he increased and maintained back pressure significantly. Further, since the airplane was fully stalled, it was not possible to minimize altitude loss.

In summary, the captain's response to the aerodynamic stall delayed the recovery of the airplane. Pulling back on the column and reducing engine power kept the airplane from achieving the necessary AOA for air flow and lift to be restored. Without awareness of the airplane's airspeed and pitch attitude as the airplane approached the stall, the captain did not recognize the prestall buffet when it occurred and, once the airplane was fully stalled, he held inappropriate nose-up pitch control and reduced power, actions which exacerbated the stall and contributed to the flight's significant altitude loss.

The first officer stated that, when the airplane pitched over, his hands were not on the controls, and he did not know what control inputs the captain made or whether he increased or decreased power. He said he first thought they should get the nose down, but then thought if they had a tail icing event that pushing forward would be wrong. The first officer stated in subsequent interviews that he did not think they had tail icing, but his initial confusion about whether the flight was experiencing an aerodynamic stall or a tail stall may have caused him to hesitate in responding.

When asked as PM, what instrument he should monitor to assist the PF in recovering from a stall, he replied ""airspeed,"" but he could not recall what the airspeed was during the event. He also could not recall the position of the fast/slow speed control indicator. As the PM, the first officer could have called out airspeed and the position of the fast/slow speed control indicator, and he could have directed the captain to apply and maintain nose-down pitch to aid in the stall recovery; however, the first officer was surprised by the airplane's loss of control and did not provide any useful assistance to the captain during the recovery.

Airplane Stall at Higher than Expected Airspeed

TAMDAR data indicated that the airplane was operating in light icing conditions. Further, as noted previously, the first officer had reported moderate mixed ice to ATC and in postincident interviews the captain described the ice as on the high end of moderate. In addition, at least four pilots reported light to moderate rime to mixed icing conditions reported in the Anchorage area before the incident, and three pilots reported moderate mixed icing conditions after the event. No pilots reported severe icing. The pilots stated in interviews that the full anti-ice and de-ice system was on during the climb from 10,000 to 14,000 feet. The first officer stated the de-icing equipment was working normally and that ice was being shed from the propeller spinner, and the captain stated the de-icing system was working normally but that it was not clearing all the ice off the airframe.

Recorded data showed the airplane lost lift at 103 knots and began a left roll at 97Â knots. According to the de Havilland DHC-8-103 stall speed chart, the stall speed for the incident airplane in the clean configuration at its weight at the time would have been 89 knots. At the time that the stall began, the airplane's airspeed was about 103 knots, 14Â knots above the predicted stall speed. Â The increased stall speed was likely due to ice buildup on the wings as evidenced by the increased drag as the airplane climbed from 10,000 feet.

Stick Shaker Operation

The FDR did not include stick shaker activation as a recorded parameter and the CVR overwrote the incident sequence. According to both pilots, the stick shaker stall warning did not activate before the airplane pitched over and the captain stated that he was ""caught completely off guard."" The pilots could not recall if the shaker began to operate at some point during the descent, but, once the captain increased engine power, noise associated with a power increase could have masked the shaker's sound. However, the flight crewmembers of another Era Aviation airplane listening on the ATC radio frequency during the event stated that they heard background sounds during radio transmissions that sounded like a stick shaker.

The Era Aviation chief pilot stated that the stick shaker normally operated at about 1.1Â Vstall and the Era Aviation FOTP approach to stalls guidance stated that the stick shaker activated about 6 knots above stall when flaps were set to 35Â°. The DHC-8-103 AFM stated that an accumulation of ice could affect the warning margin provided by the stall warning system, Because the airplane accumulated ice, the stick shaker most likely did not activate until after the onset of the stall.

Deficiencies in Era Aviation's Guidance and Training

Era Aviation's FOTP provided three climb speeds for use in the DHC-8, 130, 160, and 195 knots. The FOTP did not include a minimum climb speed, except when a flight was in severe icing conditions. In severe icing conditions, the minimum climb speed was Vsec (single engine climb speed) 15 knots, which for the incident airplane was 126 knots.

The FOTP also provided guidance on the setting of climb power; however, the guidance did not specifically require pilots to set climb power for intermediate climbs like the climb the incident flight crew performed when leaving 10,000 feet.

Following the incident, Era Aviation issued Bulletin 1-12, ""9/5 Incident Post Flight Directive/Procedural Changes."" The bulletin prescribed a minimum speed for any enroute climb to be 130 knots and required the PM to call out any airspeed degradation during the climb. The bulletin also required that all enroute climbs be made using ""standard climb power,"" unless conditions required use of max continuous power.Â  Standard power for the DHC-8 was prescribed to be as charted on the speed cards for ""1050 RPM.""

The FOTP also provided guidance on use of VS mode. The FOTP stated that VS mode shall not be used for sustained climb if the autopilot is engaged but that it could be used to establish the initial climb pitch attitude. The PM was responsible for making callouts when differences between the desired and actual paths were noted; however, the PM was not responsible for making callout when the airspeed was degraded. Bulletin 1-12 prohibited the use of VS mode for flight director pitch commands during en route climbs and required the PM to call out any degradation of climb rate to 500 feet per minute or less except for altitude capture. Therefore, at the time of the accident, Era Aviation's procedures for climb speed, climb power, and VS mode were not adequate because they did not specifically require pilots to set climb power for intermediate climbs like the climb the incident crew performed when leaving 10,000 feet.

On March 4, 2011, Bombardier issued revision 192 to the DHC8-103 AFM. The revision added Section 3.18, ""High Angle of Attack Recovery Procedures."" Under the heading, ""Recovery from Stall Warning and Stall (Stick Shaker, Unusual Airframe Buffet, Uncommanded Wing Drop),"" it stated that the first step to recover from a stall (stick shaker, unusual airframe buffet, uncommanded wing drop) was to disengage the autopilot and reduce the pitch attitude. A note was added that stated, ""Relax any control column force and/or move the control column forward to achieve a reduction in pitch attitude. This action can result in a loss of altitude."" According to the Era Aviation chief pilot, the stall recovery procedures contained in its FOTP were a continuation of a long-standing procedure, and he believed that they were consistent with section 3.18 of the AFM even though they did not reflect the idea that altitude loss was acceptable. Title 14 CFR Sections 121.133 and 121.141 require air carriers to maintain either the manufacturer's AFM or an FAA-approved operations manual that incorporates the AFM material. However, these changes were not incorporated into the company's FOTP.

The DHC8-103 AFM contained a caution, which applied to flight in all icing conditions, not just severe icing, stating, ""An accumulation of ice on the airplane may change the stall characteristics, stall speed, or warning margin provided by the stall warning system."" This caution was not provided in the Era Aviation FSM or FOTP.

Era Aviation's FOTP did not mention that the DHC-8 stall characteristics, stall speed, and stall warning margin could be affected by ice accumulation, which was less than that found in severe icing. Further, a note in Era's FOTP section 269 stated that the section only pertained to flight in severe icing conditions and that forecast or reported icing conditions need not cause any operational impact. The effect of this note was to lower pilots' concerns about the effect of icing on the airplane's performance.

The incident pilots were aware of Era Aviation's guidance on flight in severe icing, but they judged that the ice accumulation was not severe. Even though they were well aware of the ice forming on the airplane and they were attempting to climb to an altitude free of icing conditions, they were surprised by the onset of the aerodynamic stall and were confused by the fact that the stall warning stick shaker did not activate before the airplane stalled.

Even though the de-icing equipment was in use and icing conditions were only light to moderate, the airplane accumulated sufficient ice to increase its stall speed above the normal stall speed shown in the DHC8-103 AFM, and the incident pilots were apparently not cognizant of the possibility of an early stall and a stall before stick shaker in less than severe icing conditions and did not respond appropriately to the stall event.

Era Aviation's Supervision of the Incident Pilots

Despite a record of success, the captain showed occasional lapses of attention and judgment. A former check airman said he performed well in the simulator but was not always attentive. The check airman said the captain once made multiple attempts to land the DHC-8 at a field where crosswinds were 40 knots, which is greater than allowable limits (the AFM maximum allowable crosswind component for the DHC8-103 is 36 knots). A first officer stated that the captain was sometimes talkative in flight and they had to stop talking to give priority to the mission. Some first officers had expressed concerns that he sometimes lacked focus and attention and was not always ""in the moment."" Other pilots had commented to the assistant chief pilot that the incident captain was not unsafe but that he could get behind the airplane.

An examination of Alaska State driving records indicated that the captain had 10Â moving violations in the 5 years before the incident. On June 15, 2010, Era Aviation issued a driving restriction to the captain that prohibited him from operating any company motor vehicles after the captain disclosed to the company that he had been in a traffic accident that was his fault. The Era Aviation vice president of operations stated that the captain had recently operated a flight without the logbook on board and, as a result, he was planning to issue the captain an administrative action. Although the captain had a generally good record, he showed occasional lapses of attention and judgment, which company management and pilots were aware of but took no actions to address.

A captain who had flown with the first officer indicated that he could not do a lot of things at once and ""needed time to get his ducks in a row."" He stated the first officer's situational awareness was weaker than other pilots. Another captain who had flown with the first officer said he could get flustered and become easily overwhelmed with routine tasks such as weight and balance.

The first officer was disapproved for his commercial airplane single engine land certificate on November 4, 2003. Areas of operation not approved were short-field landing, 180Â° power-off landing, steep turns, and cross-country navigation. The certificate was approved on January 2, 2004. The first officer was disapproved for his flight instructor Ã¢Â€Â“ glider certificate on April 28, 2004. Areas of operation not approved were launches and landings, slips to landings, timing, judgment, and control technique during transition from slip to touchdown Ã¢Â€Â“ failure to align longitudinal axis with desired landing path. The certificate was approved on May 21, 2004.

In addition, the first officer was disapproved for his ATP certificate during an ATP reexamination flight that was conducted on September 12, 2008, after he was involved in an accident on August 4, 2008, in a PA-31. During postincident interviews, the FAA inspector who conducted that check stated that the first officer's performance in taxiing, precision approach, missed approach, and airspeed control was unsatisfactory and that his overall competency was in question. He was given the opportunity to retake the reexamination flight or surrender his ATP certificate, and the first officer chose to surrender the ATP certificate in exchange for the reissuance of his commercial certificate on September 22, 2008, after requalifying in the BE-1900. Despite the accident, the first officer was approved by Frontier Flying Service to return to work as a BE-1900 first officer, which was his position before training on the PA-31. The CEO of Era Alaska, who had also been the president of Frontier Flying Service, was aware of the first officer's accident and re-examination failure and approved him for continued employment and his subsequent transfer to Era Aviation.

The Era Aviation chief pilot said that one of the minimum qualification requirements for employment as a pilot at the company was no certificate action within the last 36Â months. As noted, the first officer failed an FAA ATP flight examination 25Â months before being approved for employment at Era. Despite the first officer's involvement in an accident, his subsequent re-examination failure, and not meeting Era Aviation's minimum qualification requirements for employment as a pilot, he was approved for continued employment and subsequent transfer to Era Aviation.

Probable Cause: an in-flight loss of control due to the flight crew's inattention to airspeed, pitch attitude, and engine power during the climb leading to an aerodynamic stall. Contributing to the incident was the flight crew's failure to recognize and properly recover from an aerodynamic stall in a timely manner.

At the same time, a Sault College Zlin 242 with a student pilot and instructor aboard was on a training flight southeast of the airport, intending to practise spins. While climbing through approximately 4000 feet after receiving clearance by air traffic control, the DHC-8 flight crew received a traffic advisory from the aircraftâ€™s traffic alert and collision avoidance system and spotted the Zlin 3 miles ahead and 1000 feet above. The DHC-8 levelled off at 4500 feet, but the Zlin entered a practice spin, resulting in a rapid descending turn towards the DHC-8. The DHC-8 flight crew took evasive action, and the Zlin passed on the right side of them, separated laterally by 350 to 450 feet (107-137 meters).

The TSB investigation found that the altitude portion of the radar target representing the Zlin went unnoticed when air traffic control cleared the DHC-8 to turn to a specified waypoint and climb. While the Zlin flight crew did a visual scan prior to the spin, they did not see the DHC-8, possibly due to its position below the aircraft, or to a lack of anticipation of conflicting traffic. The DHC-8 flight crew was unaware of the possibility of training aircraft in their vicinity and had no reason to anticipate that the opposing traffic would enter a spin and rapidly descend towards them. The investigation observed that there is an increased risk of collision if flight training exercises take place in airspace not specifically designated for them, or if they are not known to air traffic control.

Following the occurrence, Sault College changed their program, which now requires its pilots to notify air traffic control when they intend to practise spins within 10 nautical miles of the control zone, and prohibits spins within the departure and approach paths of airports in the surrounding area.

Marie Airport, ON (YAM)",sub,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/320348,Dash 8-100,DH8A,18:25,078,Pratt & Whitney Canada PW120A,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 18,0,Accident,Landing,Passenger - Scheduled,"Toronto-Pearson International Airport, ON (YYZ/CYYZ)","Sault Ste. Marie Airport, ON (YAM/CYAM)","Air Canada Express flight 7795 was a scheduled domestic flight from Toronto/Lester B. Pearson International Airport, Canada, to Sault Ste. Marie Airport.
On board the DHC-8-102 aircraft were 15 passengers, 2 flight crew members, and 1 cabin crew member. The captain performed the role of pilot flying (PF) and the first officer performed the role of pilot monitoring (PM).
Just prior to descent from cruise altitude, the PF briefed the PM for the expected approach into Sault Ste. Marie. The PF was aware of the marginal weather conditions and included the possibility of a go-around and diversion in the briefing.
As part of the briefing, the flight crew set the approach speed bugs to the appropriate speed for aircraft weight and flight conditions. The crew determined that the applicable landing reference speed (Vref) was 96 knots, which required an approach speed bug setting of 101 knots.
When the aircraft was approximately 42 nautical miles (nm) from CYAM, the controller at the Toronto Area Control Centre cleared the flight to descend to 5000 feet above sea level (ASL) and, given the expected weather conditions, requested that the crew report when they had the airport in sight for the visual approach.
As AC7795 reached 15 nm from Sault Ste. Marie in level flight at 5000 feet ASL, the crew reported that the in-flight visibility was reduced due to ice crystals. In consideration of this, they requested to be cleared for the VOR/DME approach to runway 30, rather than the visual approach, and were cleared as requested.
While descending out of 3000 feet ASL, the flight crew passed through the area of ice crystals and acquired the airport visually. Although the flight was now in visual conditions, the crew noticed a significant snow shower approaching the arrival runway from the west. They reported these conditions to the controller, who cleared the flight for the visual approach, instructing them to deviate as necessary from the VOR approach.
At 18:21:34 the aircraft passed over the final approach fix, 8.7 nm from the runway threshold, at a height of 2840 feet above ground level (AGL) and an indicated airspeed of 204 knots. The aircraft was descending on a 3Â° vertical path, although this was done visually, rather than with avionics-based vertical navigation guidance.
The aircraft slowly decelerated from 204 to 181 knots while maintaining the 3Â° vertical path in descent from 2840 feet to 1500 feet.
At 18:22:50, when AC7795 was 5 nm from Sault Ste. Marie, the flight crew contacted the Sault Ste. Marie control tower for landing clearance. The controller informed the crew that the wind was from 310Â° magnetic (M) at 22 knots with gusts to 29 knots, and mentioned the line of weather currently rolling across the runway. The controller further informed the crew that, due to this weather, the runway visual range (RVR) visibility had decreased to 1100 feet, with the runway lights set to level 4 intensity. The PM responded that they could see the approaching weather.
At 18:23:05 and at 1500 feet, the power levers were moved toward flight idle and the engine torque reduced to between 3% and 4%. The aircraft began to decelerate more rapidly.
The tower controller then informed AC7795 that the RVR had now reduced to 1000 feet, with the runway lights now at level 5 (full) intensity. Wind was reported as from 310Â°M at 25 knots, and JZA7795 was cleared to land.
At 18:23:49, at 1000 feet and 2.8 nm from the runway threshold, the flaps were extended to 15Â° and the PF increased torque to 25%. The aircraft's airspeed was 148 knots.
Between 1000 feet and 500 feet on approach, the aircraft generally maintained the 3Â° vertical path as the speed decreased from 148 to 122 knots. The engine torque varied during that time between 5% and 30% to account for configuration changes and wind gusts.
At 500 feet, the airspeed was 122 knots, or 21 knots higher than the bugged approach speed of 101 knots. The aircraft was on the appropriate vertical path and torque was steady at 25%. The PF made the 8Â° left turn to align the aircraft with the runway heading.
At 18:24:56, air traffic control (ATC) provided one last update to JZA7795, stating that the RVR was now 1200 feet.
At 200 feet and at an airspeed of 124 knots, the PF began to reduce torque to idle and, as a result, the airspeed began to decrease rapidly. Although the aircraft's nose-up pitch was gradually increased and vertical speed was relatively stable, the vertical path steepened due to the decreasing airspeed and resultant ground speed reduction. The aircraft drifted below the 3Â° vertical path. This would normally be visually indicated by 4 red lights on the precision approach path indicator (PAPI), meaning the aircraft is too low.
At some point below 200 feet, the flight crew lost visual reference to the ground due to the approaching weather system of blowing snow. The approach was continued.
At 18:25:15, the terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) issued a verbal alert to the pilots indicating that the aircraft's height was 50 feet.
Then, at 20 feet, torque was increased toward 30%. At 18:25:19, the aircraft contacted the ground approximately 450 feet (137 meters) prior to the runway threshold at an airspeed of 94 knots.
The ground preceding the runway was covered in approximately 8 to 12 inches of snow.
The aircraft was in a level pitch attitude when it contacted the surface and touched down with a peak vertical acceleration of 2.32g.
Following touchdown, the nose landing gear assembly and wheel struck and damaged an approach light located 300 feet prior to the runway threshold. The flight crew heard a thump, but had not seen the light and were unsure what had caused the noise.
The aircraft came to a stop on the runway centreline, approximately 1500 feet past the threshold. The flight crew assessed the ground visibility as very poor, due to the blowing snow.
Unsure of the aircraft's status, the flight crew informed the tower controller that the aircraft may have landed short of the runway and may have clipped the nosewheel. The crew asked the control tower to send a vehicle to their position to assess the situation, and requested that a bus be sent to move the passengers.
When the emergency vehicles arrived and assessed the condition of the aircraft, no significant damage was noticed. Upon receiving this information, the flight crew elected to taxi the aircraft to the gate.
The aircraft taxied to the gate without further incident, and the crew shut down the engines and deplaned the passengers.
The crew did not believe there was damage to the aircraft and, therefore, did not pull the circuit breaker to prevent the cockpit voice recorder data from being overwritten. As a result, relevant data that would have been captured on the 30-minute cockpit voice recorder was overwritten while the aircraft remained electrically powered at the gate.
After exiting the aircraft at the gate, the crew was notified of damage to an approach light and contacted maintenance to have the aircraft inspected.
The aircraft sustained significant damage, mostly localized to the area near the nose landing gear, which had struck the approach light.
The nose gear and nose gear doors were damaged and required replacement. Additionally, both main landing gear were determined to have exceeded load limits and required replacement.

Findings as to causes and contributing factors:
1. The company standard operating procedures require an approach speed of Vref + 5 knots; however, this is being interpreted by flight crews as a target to which they should decelerate, from 120 knots, once the aircraft is below 500 feet. As a result, the majority of examined approaches, including the occurrence approach, were unstable, due to this deceleration.
2. Due to ambiguity in the guidance and uncertainty as to the required speeds during the approach, the crew did not recognize that the approach was unstable, and continued.
3. On the approach, the pilot flying reduced power to idle to reduce the approach speed from 122 knots toward 101 knots at 200 feet above ground level. This steepened the aircraft's vertical path.
4. The rapidly decreasing visibility resulted in the airport environment and the precision approach path indicator lights becoming obscured; as a result, the steepened vertical profile went unnoticed and uncorrected.
5. Although the loss of visual reference required a go-around, the crew continued the approach to land as a result of plan continuation bias.
6. The terrain awareness and warning system did not alert the crew to the aircraft's proximity to the ground once the aircraft was below 50 feet, possibly due to the rapid rate of closure. This lack of warning contributed to the crew not being aware of the aircraft's height above ground.
7. Due to the uncorrected steepened vertical profile, loss of visual reference, and lack of normal terrain warning, the aircraft contacted the surface approximately 450 feet prior to the runway threshold.

Findings as to risk:
1. If guidance provided to flight crews allows for large tolerance windows, and crews are not trained to recognize an unstable condition, then there is a continued risk that flights that are unstable will be continued to a landing.
2. If approaches that require excessive deceleration below established stabilization heights are routinely flown, then there is a continued risk of an approach or landing accident.
3. If crews do not report unstable approaches and operators do not conduct flight data monitoring but rely only on safety management system reports to determine the frequency of unstable approaches, there is a risk that these issues will persist and contribute to an accident.

While still on the ground at Montréal, the crew reviewed the weather forecast for the occurrence flight, which was scheduled to depart at 17:45. The weather forecast called for severe clear icing conditions and turbulence near Mont-Joli as a warm front was approaching from the west. Because the weather system appeared to be moving faster than originally forecasted, the crew expressed their concern to the company flight dispatcher about possible icing conditions at Mont-Joli, as well as the possibility that the return flight would not be able to leave because of the area of freezing rain that might be affecting the airport by the time the aircraft was scheduled to take off from Mont-Joli. However, the weather still met legal, as well as company, requirements for dispatch, so the crew and the flight dispatcher agreed that the flight could proceed as scheduled.
At 17:57, JZA8964 left Montréal with 24 passengers and 3 crew members on board. The pilot-in-command (PIC) was the pilot flying (PF), and the first officer was the pilot monitoring (PM). After take-off, the aircraft climbed to its cruising altitude of flight level 250. At 18:38, when it was 119 nautical miles (nm) west of Mont-Joli, the aircraft commenced the descent for a planned straight-in area navigation approach for runway 06. To minimize the exposure to icing and turbulence, the crew planned to fly a steeper descent.
At 18:43, the Montréal Area Control Centre controller enquired if the crew was aware of significant meteorological information (SIGMET) J8, advising of an area of freezing rain and severe icing below 6000 feet above ground level (AGL) in an area 30 nm west of Mont-Joli. The PM replied that they had seen the area on the graphical area forecast (GFA).
At 18:48, approximately 55 nm from Mont-Joli, JZA8964 levelled off at 14000 feet for a period of approximately 3 minutes to remain clear of cloud and turbulence. The crew reduced the airspeed from approximately 200 KCAS to 170 KCAS, to avoid being required to carry out a holding procedure because an aircraft was approaching Mont-Joli from the east. The descent resumed at 18:51, 50 nm from Mont-Joli, with an average rate of descent of 1100 feet per minute (fpm).
At 18:50, the PM contacted Mont-Joli Radio to request a pilot weather report from an aircraft on approach ahead of them. That aircraft was on approach for runway 24. When asked, the crew of the approaching aircraft confirmed that they had encountered turbulence starting at 4000 feet and that they had acquired visual contact with the airport at 2200 feet. When questioned about entering the cloud layer and possible icing, the crew replied ""11000 feet,"" but did not provide any further details.
At 18:52, Montréal Area Control Centre cleared JZA8964 for an approach to Mont-Joli and transferred the flight to Mont-Joli Radio. On initial contact, the crew confirmed that they were 12 nm from the initial approach waypoint EPMAL, and were planning an area navigation approach for runway 06.
At 18:56, Mont-Joli Radio asked JZA8964 if they were aware of SIGMET J8, to which the crew replied that they were. Two minutes later, Mont-Joli Radio broadcasted SIGMET J8, in both French and English, over the mandatory frequency.
At 19:00, the PF asked whether it was normal procedure to broadcast a SIGMET live. Mont-Joli Radio replied that it is standard procedure to broadcast all SIGMETs affecting a 20 nm radius around the airport. The PF advised that the broadcast was a distraction while dealing with the higher workload associated with preparing for an instrument approach. A few seconds after this discussion, the aircraft passed the intermediate waypoint APNAM, as it descended through 4300 feet, with an approximate speed of 170 KCAS.
The power was reduced to idle, the gear was lowered, and the speed was stabilized at approximately 150 KCAS in this configuration with the autopilot in vertical speed (VS) mode. At 19:01, the airspeed gradually increased to 171 KCAS as the aircraft descended from 3340 to 2480 feet.
At 19:01:39, the aircraft encountered moderate turbulence when it was approximately 6.1 nm from the threshold of runway 06, descending through 2480 feet. A few seconds later, the maximum landing gear extended speed (VLE) of 172 KCAS was exceeded. The PF disconnected the autopilot, immediately levelled off, and, once the airspeed decreased to 160 KCAS, resumed the descent.
During the turbulence encounter, the PF felt a sudden change in elevator force and perceived this as a reduction of elevator control effectiveness. The crew did not declare an emergency during this event. Shortly after, the PF noticed that the TAIL advisory light for the outer left de-ice boot on the de-icing panel did not illuminate. Given the workload associated with the approach phase, the de-ice boot failure procedure indicated in the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) was not performed at that time.
The turbulence decreased at 19:03, as the aircraft descended through 1540 feet. The crew lowered the flaps to 5° at 1380 feet and further lowered the flaps to 15° at 970 feet.
JZA8964 landed normally at 19:04 and taxied to the air terminal, where the passengers disembarked. The crew made no pilot weather report regarding turbulence or icing. Post-flight examination of the aircraft showed that the critical surfaces and airframe were free of contaminants and ice. The crew tested the de-icing boot system and noticed an indication of a possible malfunction of the outer left de-ice boot.

Findings as to causes and contributing factors:
1. The landing gear extended overspeed occurred because the aircraft encountered significant increased performance shear while flying out of a low-level jet with the autopilot engaged in vertical speed mode.
2. The combination of turbulence and shear contributed to the temporary difficulty with aircraft control effectiveness on approach.
3. It is likely that the expectation of significant icing, the high workload, moderate turbulence, and attention narrowing contributed to the pilot flying's perception that a reduction of elevator control effectiveness had occurred.

As the aircraft approached the cruising altitude flight level (FL) 180, the master warning activated and the cabin pressure warning light illuminated. The crew observed that the cabin altitude indicated about 12,600 ft with an excessive rate of climb, where the rate of climb indicator had gone to its maximum indicated reading. They conducted their phase one memory checklist items for a rapid depressurisation and an emergency descent. Both crewmembers fitted their oxygen masks and the captain, who was not the flying pilot, took control of the aircraft. The captain made an announcement through the aircraftâ€™s public announcement system. However, the announcement was muffled and distorted and the cabin crewmember did not understand what was being said. The first officer declared an emergency (PAN PAN) to air traffic control and advised that they were on descent through FL 175.

During the take-off run from runway 26 at CYUY, the aircraft began to veer to the left. It continued to do so until the left main landing gear rolled off the surface of the runway and hit a snow windrow 5 feet beyond the edge of the runway. The aircraft continued to veer to the left and came to rest in a compacted snowbank 40 feet from the runway. One of the passengers received minor injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, landing gear, and propellers. The accident occurred during the hours of darkness, when visibility was reduced to approximately 2 statute miles in snow showers.

Findings as to causes and contributing factors:
1. The pilot flying did not look far enough ahead for long enough to notice that the aircraft was deviating to the left before veering off the runway.
2. Given that the pilot monitoring was not looking out the window to monitor the aircraftÂ’s path, he did not notice the deviation and was therefore unable to help the pilot flying correct the deviation in the path during the take-off roll.
3. The strong authority gradient between the pilots reduced the effectiveness of monitoring, which resulted in a failure to detect and correct the deviation from the departure path.
4. During the takeoff-rejection procedure, the pilot flying accidentally caught the right engine power lever with his finger, pushing the lever completely forward, and placed only the left lever in the idle position, which produced a significant dissymmetry in the torque and accentuated the deviation from the path, resulting in the runway excursion.
5. Since the pilot flying was able to place only 1 power lever in the idle position, it is highly likely that he did not have his right hand on the levers, contrary to what is stated in the standard operating procedures. Consequently, he was not ready to quickly and safely reject the takeoff.

As the aircraft approached 10,000 ft, the flight crew carried out transition altitude checklist items and observed that the cabin had not pressurised. The flight crew decided to return to Perth and the aircraft landed uneventfully.

The aircraft had been undergoing maintenance on the day prior to the occurrence, and for operational reasons the recirculation fan had been removed for fitment to another aircraft. VHâ€‘QQD had not been removed from the schedule as the assigned aircraft for the flight, and its unserviceability was not detected prior to flight. The absence of the recirculation fan on the occurrence flight prevented the aircraft from pressurising.

The operatorâ€™s operations department incorrectly interpreted a message from its engineering department regarding the serviceability status of VHâ€‘QQD, and it remained assigned to the charter flight. This allocation remained on the flight crewâ€™s roster and the flight manifest, which contributed to the flight crewâ€™s confidence that the aircraft was serviceable.

As there were no allowable defects against the aircraft, the captain did not check the maintenance log prior to flight and, as a result, did not detect that the recirculation fan had been removed. However, during pre-flight activities the captain observed the circuit breaker that had been opened to facilitate the recirculation fan removal. The captain reset the circuit breaker without reviewing the maintenance log for recent or open defects as per the operatorâ€™s flight crew operating manual.

Approaching top of descent, the flight crew were alerted to an engine control unit (ECU) failure on the right engine. The ECU failure meant that reverse thrust would not be available on the right engine to assist in decelerating the aircraft on landing, but they assessed it was safe to continue with the planned approach.

During the landing, the aircraft veered to the left of the runway centreline. Towards the end of the runway, the left main landing gear ran off the runway.

Contributing factors
- After landing, the anti-skid system activated when the outer right main wheel locked up, resulting in reduced braking effectiveness.
- While managing the combination of unrelated technical failures affecting directional control, the aircraft veered off the narrow runway.

The crew reduced the engine power and returned the aircraft to Cairns.

The engine examination revealed that the reported problem was the result of a failure of the number 5 bearing. The bearing cage contained two cracks and was open. Some roller pockets in the bearing cage were enlarged and distorted, which allowed the rollers to rotate in the plane of the cage. Some other rollers were immobilised and contained large flats. Six of the 12 rollers had a smaller diameter than the rest. Their surface was abraded and smeared, consistent with heavy contact loads.

Because of several similar failures, the engine manufacturer had issued service bulletin number 21472R2, on 25 February 1999, introducing an improved number 5 bearing. The service bulletin advised that engines of serial numbers subsequent to the failed engine were already fitted with the new bearing. It further recommended that number 5 bearings on all other Pratt & Whitney PW100 engine models should be replaced when the engines were disassembled and access was available.

There were no injuries to the 12 crewmembers and 235 passengers aboard the Airbus or to the 3 crewmembers and 20 passengers aboard the DHC-8. There was minor damage to the left winglet of the Airbus and substantial damage to the tail of the DHC-8. The Airbus was operated by Northwest Airlines as flight number 5, a scheduled international passenger flight from Portland to Narita Airport, Japan. The DHC-8 was operated by Horizon Air as flight number 2066, a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Medford, Oregon to Portland.

The Airbus was taxiing east via Taxiway B to runway 28L for departure. The DHC-8 had landed, taxied to the gate area, and was stopped on the ramp located north of Taxiway B waiting to be marshalled to its parking spot. The DHC-8 was sitting on a northerly heading, oriented perpendicular to Taxiway B with its tail towards the taxiway. As the Airbus passed behind the DHC-8, the left wingtip of the Airbus struck the tail of the DHC-8. The left winglet of the Airbus was scraped, bent and cracked. The vertical stabilizer, horizontal stabilizer, both elevators, and the rudder on the Bombardier sustained structural damage.

The entire tail section of N363PH were replaced by the tail of a DHC-8-100, N231ES, that was being scrapped.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The failure of the flightcrew of the other airplane to maintain clearance while taxiing.""

The damage was found during a maintenance C-check inspection on August 29, 2009. The damage was found when maintenance personnel were inspecting the inside of the tail section and noticed bowing and bending in the support structure and damage to nearby rivets. The damage was consistent with tail strike damage and had resulted in a puncture of the pressure vessel of the airplane. According to the maintenance task cards for different inspections of the airplane, an exterior inspection was to be completed prior to any other work. At least three exterior inspections were completed within the weeks preceding the discovery of the damage, including the inspection in which the damage was discovered. Each inspection required examination of the damaged area. Because maintenance personnel likely missed the damage during these inspections, pilots performing preflight checks of the airplane would be just as likely to miss the damage. Due to the height of the damage personnel would likely need to bend down in order to see it.

Probable Cause: Undetermined.

All nine persons on board survived.
The airplane was assigned to the 524th Special Operations Squadron, 27th Special Operations Wing, U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command. It was used to conduct a passenger and cargo transportation sortie in support of United States Africa Command from Nouakchott Airport (NKC), Mauritania to Bamako Airport (BKO).
The crew had diplomatic clearance to on-load 4000 liters of fuel. Although two fuel trucks arrived, the pilots determined fuel was not necessary and the captain decided not to refuel.
The airplane departed at 12:29. At 13:41, 280 miles prior to Bamako, the crew began a descent out of FL250. At 14:35, 105 miles prior to Bamako, the crew leveled off at 6,000 ft. At 14:52, the crew diverted northeast to Kolokani, an airstrip 12 miles closer than Bamako. At 15:09, the #2 (right) engine shut down due to fuel exhaustion. At 15:14Z, 29 seconds prior to impact, the #1 (left) engine began to shut down due to fuel exhaustion. An forced landing was carried out. The right hand wing separated and the undercarriage collapsed. The airplane was a total loss with a cost estimate of $7,000,000.

The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) President found by clear and convincing evidence that the cause of this mishap was the mishap aircraft running out of fuel due to the mishap aircraft commanderÂ’s and mishap copilotÂ’s failure to properly fuel plan and then refuel the mishap aircraft at Nouakchott with a sufficient amount to reach their destination. Once airborne, despite indications of a fuel shortage, the mishap crew did not divert to a suitable alternate airport early enough in the sortie to avoid this mishap. The AIB President also found sufficient evidence to conclude the following factors substantially contributed to the mishap: insufficient mission and flight planning; faulty decision-making; complacency; task misprioritization; channelized attention; and the mishap crew pressing to meet mission demands."

Flight GL-3205 originated in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. Three passengers were taken to the hospital for observation, there were no fatalities or serious injuries.
On initial radio contact with Ilulissat AFIS, the flight crew got the information that runway 07 was in use. Weather information showed wind from 150Â° magnetic at 24 knots, maximum 33 knots, minimum 17 knots; a 24 knots cross wind, and a headwind of 5 knots. The wind at threshold runway 25 was gusting to 41 knots. Visibility was fine (10 km) with broken clouds at 12000 feet.
The flight crew got visual contact with the Ilulissat area and due to the wind conditions and consequently expected turbulence on final, the flight crew prepared for a NDB/DME approach to runway 07 via JV NDB. Due to the cross wind conditions, the flight crew decided to do a landing with a flap setting of 15Â°.
The flight crew asked Ilulissat AFIS for a confirmation of whether or not the cross winds of 24 knots included the gusting wind conditions up to maximum 33 knots. Ilulissat AFIS replied that the maximum wind was 35 knots and the cross wind was 26 knots.
On a 5 miles final to runway 07, the wind conditions were reported to be 140Â° magnetic at 28 knots with a maximum of 35 knots and a cross wind of 26 knots. On short final to runway 07, the wind conditions were reported to 140Â° magnetic and 25 knots, maximum to 39 knots.
Upon touchdown on runway 07, the left main landing gear collapsed. With the left main landing collapsed and after approximately 104 meters of runway rolling, the flight crew started to loose aircraft directional control. After approximately 389 meters, the aircraft ran off the left side of the runway and into the safety zone. The aircraft skidded sideways, hit the Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) to runway 25, skidded down a steep slope and impacted a rocky area approximately 10 meters below the runway elevation.
The crew members initiated an evacuation of the aircraft. The flight crew found the flight deck door jammed and evacuated the flight deck through the flight compartment emergency exit hatch. The cabin crew member and a passenger had difficulties opening a partly jammed main entrance door. In cooperation with the commander from the outside of the aircraft, they succeeded. From the outside of the aircraft, the commander opened the forward right hand cabin emergency exit door. The passengers and the cabin crew member evacuated the passenger cabin trough the main entrance door. The overall evacuation took approximately 30-40 seconds.
Ilulissat Airport has a single, 07/25 asphalt runway, 845 m (2772 ft) long. Runway 07 has a 0,8% downslope for the first 550 m, followed by a 0,2% upslope for 295 m.

Conclusion:
Adverse crosswind conditions at BGJN led to flight crew target fixation, a flight crew divergence from the operator's stabilized approach parameters and a mental blocking of an appropriate decision on going around.
The flight crew divergence from the operator's stabilized approach parameters induced a non-stabilized approach, which in combination with power levers retarded below flight idle in flight resulted in an accelerated rate of descent leading to a hard landing, with side load on the left main landing gear at touchdown.
The left main landing gear structural fuse pin sheared as a result of lateral and vertical overload stress.
Cycling the power levers between ground and flight range prevented an appropriate deceleration of the aircraft and prolonged the landing roll.
The prolonged landing roll combined with the application of full left rudder and no decisive use of reverse thrust on the side with the unaffected main landing gear made it impossible for the flight crew to maintain directional control.
The lack of directional control resulted in the aircraft running off the side of the runway and the safety zone, respectively.

The damage were found after the training flight was completed. The crew were uninjured.

Japan Transport Safety Board says the trainee probably changed from a crab approach to a wing-low attitude to counter the crosswind, and that the aircraft initially contacted the runway with its right-hand main gear.

The Dash 8 bounced and pitched up slightly, says the inquiry, and the trainee pushed on the control column – a decision which “abruptly” caused the aircraft to pitch to 4.57° nose-down.

JTSB says the trainee had thought the nose of the turboprop was “taking longer” to lower than it should have.

He had also been influenced by the captain’s observations that he tended to pitch the nose too high while switching from crabbing to a wing-low attitude, and that he also needed to push harder on the control column to maintain direction during take-off.

JTSB says the recorded impact was 2.016g, and this caused the shock strut brace of the nose-gear to contact the runway surface.

It is probable that the accident occurred while the aircraft was landing under strong crosswind, under the condition that the main landing gear grounded without sufficient load being applied, the nose of the airplane downed excessively and the nose landing gear grounded heavily, which caused damage on the nose landing gear and the deformation of the right and left fuselage skins.

As for the nose landing gear of the aircraft grounding heavily, it is probable that the trainee continuously downed the nose, and subsequently the captain who was the instructor failed to provided an appropriate corrective operation.

Paamiut (BGPT). The commander was the pilot flying and the first officer was the pilot monitoring.
En route to Paamiut, the flight crew got information on low braking action coefficients, which precluded a landing. For that reason, the flight crew decided to divert back to GodthÃ¥b/Nuuk Airport.
The flight crew got the following information on runway in use , weather and runway conditions at Nuuk: Runway in use was 02, the wind conditions were calm with a visibility of 3000 meters in light snow and a vertical visibility of 2000 feet. The temperature was - 2Â°C and the runway conditions were reported to be the same as when the flight departed Nuuk.

The flight crew decided to do a circling area navigation (RNAV) global navigation satellite system (GNSS) approach to runway 05. The aircraft circled west of the aerodrome for landing on runway 23. Before landing, the wind conditions were reported to be variable and 2 knots. The landing was done with a flap setting of 35Â°.
Upon landing on runway 23 and after having selected reverse on both engines, the flight crew experienced that the aircraft started to veer unexpectedly to the left.
The flight crew attempted to correct this by deactivating reverse on both engines, use of the wheel brakes, and nose wheel steering but the aircraft continued veering towards the left side of the runway.
The aircraft ran off the left side of the runway and came to a complete stop in the safety zone. There were no visible or noticeable damage to the aircraft and none of the persons on board sustained any injuries.

A momentary failure of the right hand power lever micro switch causing a momentary activation of the right hand propeller beta backup protection in combination with a divergence between reported and effective braking action coefficients on runway 23 had a negative effect on the flight crewâ€™s ability to maintain directional control, which resulted in the aircraft running off the side of the runway.

The pilot of IOA reported to ZZJ that they were approaching a 3 NM final for runway 14 and ZZJ would have time to depart from runway 08 if they were quick. The pilot of IOA reported that at about 300 ft on final approach, they broadcast â€˜hold shortâ€™ to ZZJ, which was accelerating down the runway. However, the captain of ZZJ reported they heard the pilot of IOA say â€˜land and hold short of runway 08â€™ and therefore continued their take-off. As IOA approached 100â€“150 ft, ZZJ had not crossed the runway intersection and the pilot flying IOA conducted a left climbing turn away from the runways. The captain of ZZJ looked out their left window when they were in the initial climb overhead the threshold of runway 26 and saw IOA turning through east at about the same level."

The aircraft, a DHC-8-200 was scheduled to depart for Sisimiut, Greenland at 15:35 UTC. The flight was about an hour late when it received taxi instructions at 16:36 UTC.
The Sondrestrom Tower (TWR) controller cleared the flight to line up on runway 27 via taxiway A. The flight crew of OY-GRO read back the taxi instructions.
Sondrestrom TWR then instructed three runway snow clearing vehicles to vacate runway 27.
The flight crew of OY-GRO lined up the aircraft on runway 27 and completed the before take-off checklist. The flight crew was in doubt about whether or not a take-off clearance had been issued but agreed that the aircraft was cleared for take-off.
There was no visual contact with the three runway snow clearing vehicles on runway 27 because of the runway downslope.
The student air traffic controller at Sondrestrom TWR observed that OY-GRO had started its take-off roll and pointed it out to the instructor air traffic controller. For a short while, the instructor air traffic controller considered an instruction on aborting the take-off roll of OY-GRO, but noticed that OY-GRO started rotating.
When OY-GRO rotated, the horizontal separation to the nearest runway snow clearing vehicle on the runway was approximately 900 meters. The vertical separation, when OY-GRO passed overhead the nearest runway snow clearing vehicle on the runway, was approximately 300 feet.


CONCLUSIONS:
OY-GRO departed from an engaged runway at BGSF without an ATC take-off clearance.
To the AIB, the following combined conditions had an influence on the sequence of events:
- The actual flight was approximately one hour behind the scheduled time of departure.
- An over-motivated flight crew acted from their expectations rather than the factual reality.
- Runway downslope prevented the flight crew from spotting the three runway snow clearing vehicles.
- Soft safety barriers like the applied ATC phraseology and the flight crew standard operating procedures on use of landing lights did not provoke or raise the attention of the flight crew in such a way that their decision making process changed.

According to the Technical Log, the aircraft was serviceable when it arrived at Port Moresby at 07:31 hours.
The aircraft was scheduled for flight PX864, from Port Moresby to Tari on the same day. The pilots carried out a normal pre-flight inspection of the aircraft before it was released to service by the licensed engineer on duty. After obtaining a clearance from air traffic control (ATC), P2-ANK departed from runway 14L at 09:04, then made a right turn, and commenced tracking on the 298Â°R of the Port Moresby VOR for Tari, under IFR procedures. There were 28 passengers, two pilots, and one flight attendant on board. At about 09:20 while 39 nm west-northwest of Port Moresby and passing 20,000 ft during the climb, both pilots heard a bang sound, and felt the aircraft shudder.
The copilot reported that he first thought that it was an engine failure. However, visual checks of the engines and instrument gauges showed that both engines were operating normally. He then did a further quick scan of the instrument panel and said that he saw the ""unsafe left hand main landing gear door indication"" amber light illuminated. He said that he immediately advised the pilot in command (PIC). The copilot then informed ATC of their intention to return to Port Moresby, and that a normal approach and landing was expected.
The flight attendant then alerted both pilots that the left main landing gear door was open. That confirmed the reason for the illuminated left main landing gear door OPEN Advisory light. The PIC referred to the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) as a precaution, and descended to remain below 15,000 ft, and not above 130 knots.
At 10 nm from Port Moresby, the copilot requested clearance from ATC to track west of Port Moresby to the Daugo Island area, to hold for 30-40 minutes and burn-off fuel, due to the maximum allowable landing weight.
After burning off the excess fuel to achieve a landing weight of 15,650 kgs, they requested a clearance from ATC to continue descent to Jacksons for a landing.
After obtaining a clearance to land the copilot selected the landing gear down. With the landing gear fully extended, the cockpit indication was three green lights illuminated. The copilot conducted a cross-check against the alternate landing gear selection, which showed three green lights illuminated. They proceed to land, assured that the nose- and main- landing gear were safe. At 10:46, the aircraft landed on runway 14L, and was cleared to cross runway 14R to the parking area.
The PIC reported that it was at that moment they realized that everyone on the tarmac was looking at the aircraft, particularly the left side. It wasnÂ’t until the passengers and the crew disembarked, that the crew were advised by the engineers that panels were missing aft of the left exhaust nacelle.
Further inspection found that the left main landing gear number-two tyre was deflated and damaged. It was apparent that when the tyre blew out in the wheel well, it caused substantial damage to the main structure on the inside of the nacelle. It was then the crew realised that the bang sound they heard was the tyre exploding in flight at 20,000 ft.

It is likely that the FOD damage occurred when a jagged rock impacted the non-serial sidewall of the number two tyre during the landing at Bulolo on 3 August 2017. The aircraft returned to Jacksons safely, but the damage was not found during post-and pre-flight inspections. During the subsequent flight after departure from Jacksons on 4 August, the casing plies in the impacted area fractured, propagating from the serial side sidewall along the cord direction to tread area and the non-serial side sidewall. It is likely that the significantly damaged and weakened casing of the tyre, and the differential of the atmospheric pressure compared with the pressure within the tyre, caused the tyre to blow out, resulting in substantial damage to the left nacelle.

Three crewmembers and 29 passengers were onboard the aircraft. The commander was the pilot monitoring, and the first officer was the pilot flying.
Before the flight and in order to mitigate a forward center of gravity issue, an off duty crewmember moved from the cockpit jump seat to a passenger seat. The CG was now calculated to be within limits.
Before engine start, the first officer made a departure briefing including information on aircraft takeoff configuration (a flap setting of 15°), a V1 (decision speed) equal to VR (rotation speed) of 88 knots, and a review of the aborted take-off procedure.
After engine start, Nuuk AFIS reported no traffic on the runway and the wind conditions to be 330°and 3 knots. The aircraft then taxied to take-off position on runway 05 and the flight crew completed the before take-off checklist which including a check of aircraft flight controls without remarks.
The first officer then initiated the take-off roll. During the take-off roll, the commander called Sixty (airspeed), and the first officer confirmed.
At approximately 80 knots, the commander called Vee-One-Rotate. The first officer applied normal back pressure to the elevator control but experienced no positive responsive feedback (aircraft rotation) and consequentially applied full aft backpressure to the elevator control.
The first officer received no positive responsive feedback (aircraft rotation), and considered the lack of aircraft rotation to be a result of a flight control failure and aborted the take-off by retarding the power levers to DISC position and applying maximum anti-skid braking.
The aircraft came to a full stop approximately 50 meters before the end of runway 05. The flight crew discussed different scenarios and agreed that the sequence of events did not prevent them from making a safe taxi back to the apron.

The mass and balance calculation, based on actual masses (an increase of masses compared to standard masses of approximately 13% on crew, wardrobe, passengers and carry-on hand baggage), prepared by the investigators resulted in a CG 2.4 inches forward of and outside aircraft operational CG limitations.



HCLJ Conclusions:
Actual masses above standard masses on crew, passengers and carry-on hand baggage led to a CG forward of the operational aircraft CG limitations causing reduced aircraft rotation ability during the take-off roll.

The three crewmembers and 50 passengers were not injured.
At the time of the accident the airplane was parked at the passenger gate and was being prepared for departure. The engines were stopped, the chocks were in place, the pilots were seated in the cockpit completing weight and balance paperwork, and the airstair door was open.
Meanwhile a baggage tractor had broken down. While the tractor was being pushed out of the way by another tractor. Both tractors contacted each other in the process. This caused the driver to lose his seat and be pitched halfway off the left side. The driver's right hand pulled the steering wheel down to the right, and his right foot pressed on the accelerator pedal The tractor then smashed into the left side of the nose of N433AW.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The vehicle operator's improper handling of the baggage tractor resulting in loss of control of a second baggage tractor being pushed and its subsequent collision with the airplane.""

where the wind was 280Â°/15 kt. However, the first officer reports that the normal flare to about
4Â° nose-up did not arrest the rate of descent, so he continued to increase the pitch angle. The ensuing touchdown was firm and the underside of the rear fuselage contacted the runway.

The Flight Data Recorder readout shows that, over the 30 seconds prior to touchdown, the speed had
gently reduced from VreF plus 10 kt to VREF (105 kt). It remained at this until two seconds before
touchdown, when the speed dropped to VreFminus 5 kt, as the pitch attitude was increased from the
original 4Â° to 8Âº. The initial touchdown registered 1.9 g and resulted in a small bounce, which was
followed by a 1.3 g touchdown as the pitch angle was increased to 9.7Â°. At this point, the underside
of the rear fuselage scraped along the runway and activated the ""TOUCHED RUNWAY"" warning light.
Following this, despite up-elevator being progressively increased to almost full deflection, the pitch
angle rapidly decreased and the nose gear contacted the ground. The landing run was continued and
the aircraft was taxied to the apron and shut down without further event.

Newquay-Heathrow-Plymouth. Towards the end of the third sector, inbound to Plymouth at 0922
hrs, the crew contacted Plymouth Approach Control while 13 miles east of the airport. The 0850 hrs
METAR observation for Plymouth had been passed to the crew previously by London Military
Radar Control as 100Â°/26 kt gusting 39 kt, visibility 17 km, cloud few at 2,500 feet. The temperature
was 13Â°C and the QNH 1009/QFE 992 mb. The aircraft was cleared to self position onto a left base
leg for a visual approach to Runway 13. The First Officer was the handling pilot for this sector. The
landing crosswind component was within the company limits for him to complete the landing as
handling pilot (aircraft crosswind limit 30 kt, First Officer handling crosswind limit 20 kt). The First
Officer had been flying the type for some two years and had a total flying experience of 2,834 hours,
of which 893 were on type. His 28 and 90 day flying totals were 85 and 178 hours respectively.

The maximum permitted landing weight was 41,885 lb and the actual landing weight was 40,644 lb.
The crew elected to make an approach with full flap (35Â°), using a VREF of 100 kt, which was
appropriate to a landing weight of 41,000 lb. The approach speed to be used was as recommended
by the manufacturer at VREF, to which was added half of the gust value (with an overall maximum
increment of +10 kt), giving a target approach speed of 107 kt. Plymouth Runway 13 has a
Landing Distance Available of 1,038 metres. For a 35Â° flap landing, the LDA from the company
Operations Manual was 1,007 metres (still air ), or 897 metres when factored for the steady
headwind component.

The flight crew commented that flying conditions were smooth until the aircraft descended below
1,000 feet when constant moderate turbulence and indicated airspeed fluctuations was
experienced. This turbulence had been anticipated as the crew were based at Plymouth and were
familiar with the local effects of strong winds. They decided to configure the aircraft early on the
approach, so 35Â° flap was selected at about 800 feet agl and the aircraft settled at an approach speed of around 110 kt, but fluctuating with the turbulence being experienced. The landing checks
were completed, landing clearance was obtained from ATC and a final wind check was passed as
100Â° at 20 kt gusting 30 kt. The First Officer requested confirmation that the airspeed was
acceptable on short final and the commander replied that it was good. The aircraft flared normally
with the left wing slightly down to compensate for the crosswind component and the power was
progressively reduced to flight idle. The crew considered that the aircraft touched down earlier than
anticipated, on the left main wheel first followed quickly by the right main wheel. A slight bounce
then followed before a further firm touchdown. A normal rollout ensued. The pitch attitude at the
flare and bounce did not seem excessive to the crew.

Ground contact with the rear fuselage went unnoticed by the aircraft occupants , but the flight deck
crew noted that the Red 'Touched Runway' warning caption on the CAUTION/WARNING LIGHTS PANEL was illuminated during the taxi in. The aircraft was parked and shut down normally before being withdrawn from service for repair.

The commander considered that the approach had been normal given the nature of the turbulence
and windshear experienced. He considered that an application of power at the flare to compensate
for the sudden loss of airspeed may have prevented the firm touchdown and rear fuselage strike.

The previous landing aircraft was a Piper PA-28 which landed on Runway 13 at 0924 hrs. Its pilot
indicated that he experienced a loss of airspeed of about 20 kt on short finals. He did not comment
by R/T to ATC on this experience.

He had
eaten ""bland"" food and had drunk several glasses of tap water during his stay. During the morning he
had taken exercise in the hotel gymnasium.

The aircraft departed from Newcastle Airport at 1520 hrs for a scheduled flight to Southampton
Airport, however, the visibility at Southampton was 100 meters so, at 1550 hrs, the commander
decided to divert to Bournemouth; he informed the passengers of his decision. He had experienced
some nausea shortly before this time and vomited about ten minutes later. He felt well afterwards
and continued to operate the flight to Bournemouth where the aircraft landed without incident.

There was a positioning company crew on board and the commander thought it prudent to ask the
commander of that crew to take over from him for the remaining sector. He vomited occasionally
thereafter but, after a good night's sleep, awoke feeling well.

The commander was subsequently examined by the company AME who was of the opinion that
probably he had contracted a stomach virus; he felt it unlikely that the hotel water system was the Source.

3 Feb 1997,de Havilland Canada DHC-8-311 Dash 8,OE-LRW,"Rheintalflug, opb Braathens SAFE",0,5 NM NNE of Stavanger-Sola Airport (SVG/ENZV),non,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/561867,Dash 8-300,DH8C,c. 17:20 LT,307,P&W Canada PW123,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants:,0,Serious incident,Approach,Passenger - Non-Scheduled/charter/Air Taxi,Kristiansand-Kjevik Airport (KRS/ENCM),Stavanger-Sola Airport (SVG/ENZV),"An IFR flight, BRA 4317, was en route from Kristiansand airport, Kjevik to Stavanger airport, Sola 3 February, 1997. This scheduled flight is normally operated by a Fokker 50 owned by the company ""Norwegian Air Shuttle AS"" (NAS) in co-operation with Braathens SAFE. As NAS had one aircraft in for heavy maintenance, an Austrian company - Rheintalflug, was chartered for the flight. The route was operated by a DHC-8-311.

BRA 4317 was cleared by Stavanger ATCC the route via SIRDA for approach Sola (see enclosed: STAR RWY 18). SIRDA is the initial point for a STAR to runway 18 Sola. Normal transition from Stavanger ATCC to Sola approach (ARR) took place at 1701 hours a few nautical miles before SIRDA.

After establishing normal radio contact, BRA 4317 received the following instructions from Sola ARR:

""Continue inbound Rennesoey, expect vectoring for an ILS approach runway 18, QNH 1010 and information Whiskey.""

To this instructions BRA 4317 answered:
""Ok, 1010, runway 18 and confirm where to go?""

Sola ARR:
""4317, when ready descend 5 000 ft, QNH 1010 and continue inbound Rennesoey.""

BRA 4317:
""Continue down to 5 000, 1010, thank you.""

The radio communication was made without complete callsigns and without correct readback. Further on, the use of callsigns was neglected by both parties. BRA 4317 did not repeat the NDB navigation aid ""RennesÃ¸y"" in the instructions, and Sola ARR did not call attention to this.

From the traffic strip (FPS) at Sola ARR, which is based on repetitive flight planning, BRA 4317 was stated to be a Fokker 50. It was therefore unknown to the controller that the flight was operated by a DHC-8.

Regulations regarding repetitive flight planning are to be found in Norwegian Aviation Regulations: BSL G 1-2, point 8 and BSL G 1-9 point 4.

The radio communication between BRA 4317 and Sola ARR continued:
At 1709 hours: BRA 4317: ""4317, we are 5 000 ft on ten ten, may we follow the DME 15 arc?""

After a pause, Sola ARR: ""4317 affirm.""

BRA 4317: ""DME 15 arc in to the ILS 18, thank you.""

At 1711 hours, Sola ARR: ""4317 cleared ILS approach, correction VOR/DME approach RWY 18 via SIRDA arrival, report established on the radial and descend unrestricted accordingly.""

BRA 4317 answered: ""VOR/DME approach RWY 18, we are just in a left turn, SIRDA 2B, call you established on the inbound track.""

The instructions given at 1711 hours was surprising for the crew on BRA 4317, and it was understood as the ILS runway 18 was unserviceable. As the crew now should perform a VOR/DME approach instead of the planned ILS, the operational procedures of Rheintalflug required a re-briefing on the new approach procedure. At the same time it was necessary for the crew to reset and check the navigation aids. The approach charts had to be changed. While performing these routines, the aircraft drifted off the normal approach pattern and entered an area over the city of Stavanger east of Sola on course for the town of Sandnes. At his time the aircraft had also descended to 2 000 ft and was flying in and out of clouds.

The pilot-in-command, who also was handling the communication, writes in his report that he had to ask twice in order to receive an approach clearance. He also states, that during the whole approach, he wondered about the controllers instructions and phraseology.

At 1713 hours Sola ARR contacted BRA 4317. Now the aircraft had left the normal approach pattern and was flying northeast to east of Sola:

""...317, what's happening now?""

BRA 4317 answered:
""Just correcting to the right, we got no information over on the ATIS that's only a VOR approach, sorry, we are on the right turn.""

From here on, Sola ARR gave BRA 4317 radar vectoring for an ILS approach to runway 18. A normal landing was made at 1722 hours. The pilot in command was then informed that the incident would be reported by Sola ARR to CAA.

There is a ""NOTE"" in AIP NORGE/NORWAY RAC 4-ZV-10: STANDARD ARRIVAL ROUTES - INSTRUMENT:
""Unless otherwise instructed by ATC a STAR-clearance also includes a clearance to make an instrument approach.""

The crew can find this ""Note"" in the company's Route Manual, chapter RULES AND REGULATIONS NORWAY under 13.2 ""Flight plan and clearance"". The Note is not printed on ASIR page 3 STAR rwy 18.

The pilot-in-command replies in his answer to the draft of this bulletin that he considers that a strong westerly wind component at altitude aggravated the course deviation.

Safety Recommendations:

1. The Civil Aviation Administration should consider if it is convenient to make the information in the mentioned ""Note"" in AIP NORGE/NORWAY RAC, STANDARD ARRIVAL ROUTES - INSTRUMENT in SAS Route Manual (and also Jeppesen) more accessible for the crew during an approach. It is now only stated in ""RULES AND REGULATIONS NORWAY"".

Newcastle, Bristol. The first two sectors were uneventful and the aircraft left the stand at Aberdeen
for the sector to Newcastle with the commander as handling pilot. The history of the flight was
reconstructed from the account provided by the crew and from the FDR.

The anti ice systems were selected 'ON' when the aircraft took off from Aberdeen at 1748 hrs; there
was a strong gusting crosswind and it was raining. The initial climb was normal and the landing gear
and flaps were retracted. The Standard Operating Procedure is then to deselect the auto-feather
system and select climb power, however the commander decided to retain take off power in order to
expedite the climb through the layer of moderate to severe turbulence they were experiencing; he
informed the first officer of his intention and asked for the bleed air to be switched on.The first
officer actioned the after take off check from memory, however he did not deselect the auto-feather
system because climb power had not yet been requested.

The commander selected climb power at about 2,100 feet amsl and asked the first officer to reduce
the propellers to the climb setting. Both propellers were reduced to 900 propeller RPM (Np) and the
torques increased momentarily to 100% before being reselected to 80%. The auto-feather system was
not deselected. No 1 engine torque increased slowly from 80% until stabilizing at around 90%.
However, No 2 engine torque increased rapidly to 111% and then returned to 80% over a period of
12 seconds. This was the first of many excursions of No 2 engine torque; most were in the range
10% to 20% and continued for a further 100 seconds until the commander retarded No 2 power
lever to about 62%. These excursions in Np and torque are shown in Figure 1. ATC was told of the
problem and the climb was continued with No 1 engine torque at 90%, and No 2 engine torque still
at 62%; both propellers were at 900 Np.

When the aircraft climbed out of icing conditions the commander selected the No 2 engine intake
bypass doors to be closed. Shortly afterwards, as the aircraft climbed through about 7,400 feet
amsl, No 1 propeller suddenly feathered, reducing to 400 Np and the torque on No 2 engine rose by
about 15%. In this installation it is possible to feather the propeller blades without stopping the
engine. Because the engine had not actually failed, fuel was still being scheduled to maintain the
level demanded by the power lever and consequently No 1 engine torque increased rapidly to a peak
value of 120% before being reduced to below 100%. About 100 seconds later No 1 engine torque
was further reduced to 38%, the flight idle value, and No 2 engine torque was increased slightly to
85%.

The UNSCHEDULED PROPELLER FEATHERING drill was consulted; the drill calls for the
shutdown of the engine associated with the feathered propeller. The flight deck indications were that
No 1 engine parameters were normal. Because he now thought they had two, apparently unrelated,
problems the commander decided not to shut down No 1 engine. An emergency was declared and
the aircraft diverted to RAF Leuchars.

The first officer tried to un-feather No 1 propeller using the alternate system but was unsuccessful.
As the aircraft passed about 7,000 feet amsl during descent to Leuchars, the commanders elected the
No 1 engine bypass door to closed and reduced No 2 engine torque to about 58%. This disarmed the
auto-feather system and No 1 propeller suddenly unfeathered; Np increased rapidly to 1,200 and the
torque fell to zero. There was a yaw to the rightof around 2 to 2.5Â° as the propeller unfeathered and
it appears that the commander interpreted this as a failure of the No 2 engine because, about 10
seconds later, he retarded No 2 condition lever to the START/FEATHER detent which caused the
propeller blade angle to coarsen towards the feather position. The power lever remained as selected
and No 2 engine torque increased rapidly to 100% before reducing to 55% as the lever was
subsequently retarded to FLIGHT IDLE. After 5 seconds No 2 engine torque reduced to zero in
response to the condition lever being moved fully back to FUEL OFF. Figure 2 shows the engine
torque, Np and fuel flow.

The first officer immediately told the commander that he thought he had taken the wrong action and
the latter quickly moved the condition lever fully forward to the MAX GOVERNING position.
The Np immediately increased to 1,200 and, because the igniters were still selected ON, the engine
relit. The propeller was reduced to 900 Np but because the torque gauge pointer was at zero and the
digital readout showed four dashes the crew assumed that the engine had indeed flamed out. The
FDR was also sensing a zero torque output at this stage but other parameters such as fuel-flow and
gas generator RPM (Ng) showed that the engine was still running with the power lever at a
moderate setting. The first officer attempted to relight the engine by first retarding the condition
lever to START/FEATHER. The Np reduced to 300 but the start switch would not engage as the
engine was already running. After 17 seconds the power lever was retarded to FLIGHT
IDLE, resulting in a Np of 100.

The approach was flown with both engines running normally but with the No 2 propeller feathered
and the power lever at FLIGHT IDLE; No 1 engine condition lever remained at MAX GOVERNING. An uneventful landing was made at Leuchars at about 1814hrs.

About 10 minutes later, the crew noticed illumination of a 'PITCH MISTRIM, TRIM NOSE DOWN' annunciator light. The captain attempted to trim the airplane using the manual elevator trim, but it would allow only limited movement. The crew declared an emergency, returned to Rapid City, and landed the airplane without further incident. A postincident inspection of the aft fuselage compartment revealed that one of the two master links (which held the chain and cable assembly to the electric elevator trim system) had come apart. The chain had subsequently entangled itself in the elevator trim cables. Further examination revealed that the 'C' clip (which snaps to the two posts of the master link base plate and held the master link cover plate in place) was missing.

Probable Cause: a missing 'C' clip, which resulted in the master link coming apart, allowing the electric elevator trim chain and cable to become entangled in the elevator trim cables.

8 May 1997,de Havilland Canada DHC-8-311,G-BRYR,"British Airways Express, opb Brymon Airways",0,Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG/LFPG),non,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/494020,Dash 8-300,DH8C,12:30,336,P&W Canada PW123,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 21,0,,Take off,Passenger - Scheduled,Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG/LFPG),Bristol Airport (BRS/EGGD),"On the day of the incident the crew were scheduled to operate five sectors; from Edinburgh to Bristol and then via Plymouth, Jersey, and Paris back to Bristol. The flight departed Edinburgh at 0600 hrs. On lining-up for take-off from Bristol at the beginning of the second sector, the commander noticed that the rudder pedals seemed stiff to operate, however this did not cause him undue concern and he continued with the take off. The stiffness disappeared during that sector and was not felt again until the aircraft departed from Paris on the final sector of the day.

After a short delay for air traffic clearance, the flight departed from Charles de Gaulle airport at 1220 hrs for Bristol. The wind on departure was 240_/32 kt and Runway 27R was in use, consequently there was a crosswind from the left of approximately 16 kt. After takeoff the commander, who was the handling pilot for the sector, found that he was unable to move the rudder pedals. During the subsequent climb to Flight Level (FL) 100, the landing gear and flaps were retracted with no noticeable effect on the rudder pedals,which remained immovable. Control of the
aircraft was passed to the first officer who confirmed the condition. Rudder trim was applied and movement was confirmed on the trim indicator. The flight deck switch-lights for the two rudder hydraulic actuators were then checked to ensure that they were not illuminated and to confirm filament integrity. Had either switch-light been lit, this would have indicated a failure of the respective rudder power control unit actuator linkage; however neither was illuminated. The autopilot was then selected successfully. In addition to relieving the pilots of the physical control of the aircraft, this also served to confirm that the yaw damper was operating because yaw damper
failure would have prevented autopilot coupling.

After confirming that there was no appropriate emergency drill in the aircraft Quick Reference Handbook (QRH), the crew advised Paris ATC that they had an emergency situation and requested diversion to an airfield which had a suitable into-wind runway. ATC suggested a diversion to Beauvais which is approximately 30 nm north-west of Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, for a landing on Runway 23. The surface wind was given as 240_/12 kt. On approaching Beauvais, the crew decided to delay their landing until the arrival of the full fire service cover. As that day was a public holiday in France, the fire service from the nearby town had to be called out to provide full cover, and this resulted in a 35 minute delay before a landing could be made.

During this delay, the crew were able to check their landing distance requirements. As Runway 23 was wet, they calculated that the landing distance required would be 992 meters. Although Paris ATC had advised that Runway 23 was 1,500 meters long, the flight documents for the runway showed that there was only 1,105 meters available for landing, the remainder being declared unusable. In addition, there was no runway instrument approach aid nor approach lighting available for this runway. As the runway was also slightly narrower than usual at 40 meters, the commander decided to carry out an approach to Runway 31 which was 2,430 meters long, 45 meters wide, with high intensity approach lighting and an instrument landing system (ILS). By this time the surface wind was 240_/12 kt with gusts up to 16 kt.

The crew then found that they were unable to tune the ILS using the frequency promulgated on their approach chart and on checking this with ATC they were informed that the frequency had been changed. It was later ascertained that the company which produced the chart had not promulgated the change in time for the amendment to have been incorporated in the manual prior to this flight. Having set the correct ILS frequency, the crew then carried out an uneventful approach and landing.

burning smell around seat Rows 7 to 9 which was confirmed by the passengers. The No 1
cabin attendant was instructed to switch off all the passenger service unit (PSU) reading lights,
monitor the situation and report back. The first officer subsequently went back to the cabin to
investigate, but since he was unable to detect any burning smell, the decision was made to continue
to Newcastle. However, some 5-10 minutes later, the cabin attendant reported that the smell had
returned. The commander decided to declare an emergency and divert to Birmingham. Normal
approach and landing procedures were used, as there was no smoke or fire in the cabin. Following
an uneventful landing, the cabin attendant reported that the situation had not deteriorated. It was
therefore decided that an emergency evacuation was not necessary, and the passengers disembarked
normally on the stand.

A subsequent investigation revealed that an air conditioning duct had become disconnected above
seat Row 6 C/D. It was apparent that some 'fluff' from the duct had fallen onto the back of one of the
PSU lights and had generated an acrid smell. The sections of duct are normally joined together by
means of nylon 'tie-wrap' bands and adhesive-backed fabric tape. It was noted that in this case the
duct had been joined by the use of aluminum 'speed tape', and it was loss of adhesion of this that
had allowed the duct joint to separate.

There is seldom a requirement for the ducting in this area to be disturbed, and it is likely that the
duct joint was modified by a previous operator. The PSU panels are subject to maintenance activity
on a relatively frequent basis, and the airline is instructing its maintenance personnel to check that
air duct joints are to the correct standard whenever such maintenance is carried out on its Dash 8
aircraft.

Glasgow and he had 21 hours flying experience on the Dash 8. The weather was good and the
surface wind for landing was 070Â°/21 kt. The handling pilot was making an ILS approach to
Runway 09.

The commander noted that the first officer was tending to fly the aircraft slightly slower than the
target airspeed on approach. Nevertheless, the speed had recovered to Vref plus 5 kt at touchdown.
The main wheels made a smooth contact with the runway but the commander then saw the aircraft
attitude increasing through 6Â°;he pushed forward on the control wheel and felt the nose-wheel make
a hard contact with the runway. The aircraft became airborne momentarily again and the
commander took over control and completed the landing. Subsequently, he stated that he suspected
that G-BRYT had got airborne after the initial main wheel contact and that his push on the control
wheel had then caused the aircraft to land nosewheel first.

They decided to overshoot Runway 34 at 4 miles final to try and correct the problem, but apparently they were not able to rectify the problem fully because the nosegear collapsed when the crew brought the a/c back and landed.

The damage appeared to be limited to the nosegear doors and scatches to the underside of the nose. Runway 34 was closed for about 90 minutes while maintenance raised the a/c and got the nosegear lowered.

Canadian Regional Airlines maintenance suspected that the back-up ring, which forms part of a plug assembly in the piston of the nose gear strut, was damaged at the time it was installed at overhaul. In addition, the damage may have been amplified by very cold temperatures on the day of the occurrence, and at that time, the gear had accumulated about 700 cycles since the last overhaul."

The
commander was operating as the Pilot Flying (PF) with the first officer as the Pilot Not Flying
(PNF). The 22 year old first officer had 458 hours flying experience on type. It was normal for the
aircraft to be flown, for the most part, with the auto pilot engaged. On this occasion the commander
briefed the first officer that he would probably fly the aircraft manually more than normal as he was
due to carryout a company base check in a weeks time and wanted to practice his manual flying
skills. The aircraft, which was serviceable with no recorded defects in the technical log, departed
'off chocks' at Manchester at 0629 hrs and climbed to its cruising altitude of FL180 without
incident.

The cruise phase of the flight was flown with the auto pilot engaged in ALT HOLD (Altitude Hold)
and L NAV (Lateral Navigation) modes. Aberdeen Runway 34 was in use and so the commander
briefed for a manually flown 'radar vectors to ILS' approach. The current ATIS for Aberdeen gave
the surface wind as calm with few clouds at 200 feet, scattered clouds at 800 feet and broken cloud
at 1,200 feet.

At 0735:30 hrs, during the manually flown descent to FL90 on a radar heading of 050Â°, the aircraft
was transferred to Aberdeen approach control whereupon the controller instructed the crew to
resume their own navigation for the 'ADN' VOR. The crew, however, requested to route direct to
an 8 mile centre fix position for Runway 34. The controller transmitted ""THAT'S APPROVED IT'LL BE
RADAR ADVISORY SERVICE OUTSIDE CONTROLLED AIRSPACE"". At this stage the commander
decided to re-engage the autopilot in the L NAV mode. The crew were then given the QNH of 1004
mb and QFE of 997 mb and asked by the controller if they could ""SELF ESTABLISH (on the ILS
localiser) AT EIGHT MILES"". The crew confirmed the request and at 0743 hrs were cleared to descend
to an altitude of 3,200 feet and asked to reduce speed to 180 kt. Moments later they were cleared to
descend to 2,000 feet and ""REPORT LOCALISER ESTABLISHED"". At 0745:50 hrs the crew reported
localiser established and were cleared to descend on the ILS and change to the tower frequency.

The next call from the crew was still on the approach frequency when they reported at 4.5 DME.
The approach controller was surprised to hear the aircraft still on his frequency but replied ""YOU'VE
COME OFF THE ILS BY THE LOOK OF THINGS YOU'RE TWO MILES TO THE EAST, ARE YOU SHOWING
ESTABLISHED?"" The crew replied ""NEGATIVE...WE'RE JUST TURNING BACK ON"" to which the
controller replied ""YOU HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE APPROACH?"" The crew confirmed that they were
and were transferred again to the tower frequency.

The crew made contact on the tower frequency at 0746:50 hrs reporting at 3.5 DME. The tower
controller immediately transmitted ""...CONFIRM YOU ARE VISUAL"". (Coincident with the end of this
transmission was an internal call from the radar controller to the tower controller of ""I'VE WARNED
HIM ALREADY!"") The crew transmitted 'NEGATIVE' to which the tower controller replied ""YOU'RE
CLEARED TO LAND RUNWAY THREE FOUR SURFACE WIND CALM"". The crew however immediately
responded by transmitting '...GOING AROUND'. This was acknowledged by the tower controller who
cleared them to climb to an altitude of 3,000 feet and maintain runway heading. At 0748 hrs the
aircraft was transferred back to the radar frequency.

When the aircraft came onto his frequency the radar controller asked if there had been a problem.
The crew explained that they had tried to turn onto the ILS using the Flight Management System
(FMS) but that appeared not to have worked. The controller then instructed the crew to turn right
onto a heading of 080Â°. The aircraft initially turned to the left before reversing its turn to the right.
The radar controller then asked if they could maintain 3,000 feet. The crew confirmed that they
could but the radar controller re-emphasised 3,000 feet as the cleared altitude. Data recorded on the
Flight Data Recorder (FDR) showed that the aircraft had in fact climbed to 3,800 feet and then
descended to 2,700 feet before eventually levelling at 3,000 feet.

Minutes later the radar controller transmitted ""...I ADVISED YOU (during that approach) THAT YOU
SEEMED TO BE GOING AWAY FROM THE ILS YOU SAID YOU WERE TURNING BACK (but) ONCE I'D
PUT YOU BACK TO TOWER YOU APPEARED TO GO EVEN FURTHER AWAY FROM THE ILS"". The first
officer replied ""WE ACTUALLY RECEIVED SOME GPWS SPURIOUS WARNINGS IT STARTED SHOUTING
TERRAIN TERRAIN AT US....."". The controller responded 'UNDERSTAND THAT I THINK YOU GOT
QUITE CLOSE TO THE MAST PROBABLY.""

The remainder of the radar vectored instrument pattern and subsequent ILS and landing were flown
without further incident.

Just before landing at Kinmen (KNH), one of the four men asked to see a Taiwanese official seated in the front of the plane. As the plane was landing, the official was stabbed in the neck with a sharpened part of a metal door handle. The attacker was subsequently overpowered by police, and the flight landed safely. Police later found similar crude weapons and razor blades hidden on the other three prisoners, in the lining of their clothing or in the soles of their shoes. The men reportedly staged an argument among themselves prior to leaving the detention center in order to avoid a body search, which would have revealed their weapons."

Further damage to nose landing gear, left-hand main landing gear and landing gear doors. No injuries reported by the 13 person on board (crew of 4 plus 9 passengers). According to the following excerpt from the official AAIB report into the accident:

""Following an apparently normal ILS approach to Runway 31 at Plymouth, as the aircraft was flared for landing, it suddenly lost height. G-BRYP subsequently touched down hard on its left main undercarriage. During the landing roll, due to the damage sustained on touchdown, the left main undercarriage began to collapse but the crew were able to maintain directional control and brought the aircraft to a stop on the runway.

The accident happened in daylight (11:18 hours Local time) and in VMC. Wind was 240 degrees/22 knots, gusting to 27 knots. The UK AIP (Airport Information Package) includes a warning for Plymouth City Airport, which states that 'in strong wind conditions, wind shear and turbulence may be experienced...'

Evidence from the aircraft's FDR indicated that the aircraft encountered wind shear as it entered the landing flare. The co-pilot was handling the aircraft for the landing. The Company Flying Manual Standard Operating Procedures, as amended, sets limits for when co-pilots can act as handling pilot for landings.

In part, these give a maximum wind speed of 15 knots, including gusts and a crosswind limit of '20 knots, less than the captain's', in this case 15 knots. However, it was also stated that 'captains may use their discretion in setting higher for First Officers if they consider conditions merit it.' The co-pilot considered this statement 'misleading' in relation to the limits. The company restrictions had been introduced because of the experience levels of their co-pilots and the difficulties of landing at airfields such as Plymouth.

The AAIB considers that the timing of the windshear was such that prompt and correct action would be required to recover the situation and that a 'more experienced pilot should have been able to cope with the conditions.' The crew had conducted the approach in a professional manner, and they were aware of the surface wind conditions. However, the captain was concerned about the approach.

He had asked the co-pilot if he was happy to continue but seemed reluctant to take control unless the co-pilot asked him to. 'By not taking a positive decision when he first realised the actual wind conditions and taking control..., the (captain) allowed the situation to develop into one where the co-pilot landed (the aircraft) in conditions outside his experience or authorisation.'""

12 Aug 1999,de Havilland Canada DHC-8-311 Dash 8,G-BRYP,"British Airways Express, opb Brymon Airways",0,Manchester International Airport (MAN/EGCC),sub,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/497716,Dash 8-300,DH8C,06:10,315,P&W Canada PW123,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 54,0,Accident,Standing,Passenger - Scheduled,Manchester International Airport (MAN/EGCC),Glasgow International Airport (GLA/EGPF),"The aircraft had been parked at Manchester overnight, during which time a routine pre-flight
engineering inspection had been carried out. This inspection revealed that the hydraulic fluid
contents of both systems were found to be above the required minimum dispatch quantities. It was
subsequently ascertained that this inspection had been carried out shortly after the arrival of the
aircraft during the previous evening.

The flight crew reported at 0505 hrs in order to operate a scheduled passenger service to Glasgow,
which was planned to depart at 0605 hrs. During the course of the flight crew external pre-flight
inspection, the first officer noted that the remote quantity indicator for the No 1 Hydraulic System
was indicating below the minimum level acceptable for dispatch of the aircraft (1.5 US Quarts, 1.41
litres). On reboarding the aircraft, the first officer informed the commander of this condition. The
commander checked the flight deck gauge, which displayed a hydraulic fluid content slightly
higher than the remote quantity indicator. The commander indicated that he would transfer some
fluid (from the No 2 system) during the flight. There was also some discussion with Line
Maintenance Control regarding the status of a nose landing gear alternate gear extension indicator
light, which was illuminated but dim. It was decided that it was acceptable to dispatch the aircraft
in that condition.

The passenger boarding was completed and the aircraft received ATC clearance to push back from
the stand. Both engines had been started on stand prior to the pushback in accordance with the
Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's).

The commander was in communication with the ground crew engineer via a headset. The
commander indicated that the brakes were released and the pushback commenced. The commander
noted that the hydraulic quantity in the No 1 system appeared to have dropped and he decided to
carry out a fluid transfer. About 15 seconds after brake release, the commander indicated to the
engineer that he was going to perform a hydraulic fluid transfer at the end of the pushback. The
engineer queried whether this was to be done with the tug attached or uncoupled. The commander
responded that the tug should remain attached. The engineer indicated that he would inform the tug
driver of this plan.

At this time, the engineer went across to the tug to inform the tug driver. The tug driver halted the
tug while he received this message from the engineer. No signals were passed to the commander
that would indicate that the pushback was complete and the aircraft had moved back only a few feet
from the parking position. The ground engineer returned to the side of the aircraft and informed the
commander that it was 'all right, no problem'.

Immediately upon receipt of this, the commander indicated to the first officer that he should pay
attention during the transfer to ensure that the fluid was being moved the correct way. As the
commander looked across the flight deck, he did not notice that the pushback had recommenced
very gently. The first officer had just completed an entry in the flight paperwork when he looked up
and realised that the aircraft had recommenced the pushback. He attempted to warn the commander
just as the commander applied the Emergency/Parking Brake as the first stage of the fluid transfer
process. The tug continued to attempt to push the aircraft back and the nose landing gear collapsed.
A quantity of hydraulic fluid was released as a spray from the area of the nose landing gear. The
ground engineer subsequently required treatment for the effects of hydraulic fluid contamination of
his skin and eyes.

After the nose landing gear collapse, several seconds elapsed before the first officer prompted the
commander regarding the shutdown of the engines, and the need to carry out a passenger address.
The first officer informed ATC and the emergency services were alerted to attend. The commander
shutdown the engines. He elected to carry out a precautionary disembarkation by means of the
normal passenger door and initiated this in consultation with the senior cabin crew member. None
of the aircraft occupants was injured.

The aircraft suffered very substantial damage to the underside, tail, wingtip, engines, frame, and landing gear components. Nobody was injured. The accident was attributed to poor crew handling of unstable airflow on final approach.

On January 15, 2001, Uni Air flight B7695, a DASH-8-300 aircraft with national markings and registration number B-15235, took off from Tainan Airport at 10:35 AM, carrying passengers. It landed at 11:13 AM on Runway 06 at Kinmen Shangyi Airport. Upon landing, the aircraft suffered damage to its left and right landing gear, and the rear section of the belly panel was worn through on the runway. It came to rest approximately 3,380 feet from the runway threshold. On board were two pilots, two cabin crew members, and 23 passengers.

According to the company's dispatch schedule, the pilots were scheduled to fly a total of six missions that day. The accident occurred on their second flight of the day. On the previous day, they had flown four round-trip missions between Kaohsiung and Magong.

At 10:35, the pilots took off from Tainan Airport for Kinmen, with the first pilot in command. The first pilot explained that they had also been in command of the first flight of the day, from Kaohsiung to Kinmen. While approaching for landing, they experienced unstable airflow, but the landing went smoothly, indicating they were familiar with Kinmen's weather conditions.

At 11:02, the aircraft began descending on route W-6. At 11:07, the area control center cleared the aircraft for a ""NDB/DME Bravo approach to Runway 06 at Kinmen Shangyi Airport."" At 11:09, the pilot reported a visual airport and requested a visual approach, which was subsequently cleared by the area control center.

At 11:09, Kinmen Shangyi Airport Control Tower (hereinafter referred to as the control tower) took over the aircraft. At that time, the aircraft reported a position of 8 nautical miles southeast of the airport. The control tower issued a landing clearance and provided the following information: ""Use runway 06, altimeter setting 1030 hPa, wind direction 040 degrees, wind speed 15 knots per hour, maximum wind speed 21 knots per hour, clearance to land.""

The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) data showed that the aircraft's final approach speed averaged approximately 114 knots with flaps 15 degrees. The aircraft was at an altitude of 310 feet and a heading of 060 degrees when turning onto the final leg of the airport's route. The FDR stopped recording at 11:13:55.

The pilot stated that the aircraft was at an altitude of approximately 50 feet as it passed the runway clearance area. When it dropped to approximately 30 to 20 feet, it suddenly began to sink rapidly. Just as he was about to raise the stick and apply throttle, he felt the aircraft touch down.

The cabin crew reported that as the aircraft taxied on the runway, smoke billowed from the rear cabin floor. The C3 cabin crew and passengers left their seats and moved forward before the aircraft stopped. The L1 cabin crew pressed the intercom button to call the pilot, but received no response. After the aircraft stopped, the cabin filled with smoke, and most passengers moved toward the L1 passenger door. After opening the L1 passenger door and the R2 central emergency exit door, passengers began evacuating the cabin.

According to the tower recording, at 11:14, the aircraft reported to the tower, ""I'm shutting down on the runway now, thank you."" When the tower controller asked if there was any problem, the aircraft replied, ""My tire might be punctured."" The tower controller immediately notified Kinmen Airport's flight crew to investigate. Following the notification from the flight crew, the airport fire department dispatched a fire truck to the scene.

Measurements of ground marks, detached components, and video footage from the accident indicate that the aircraft, along with its nose wheel, two main wheels, and belly, struck the ground approximately 200 feet from the runway threshold on Runway 06. The aircraft bounced off, with the right wheel door falling off. The aircraft touched down again at 1,300 feet, then dragged its rear fuselage belly-on to a stop at 3,380 feet.

Probable Cause:
The most likely cause of the Accident involving UNI Air flight B7695 was determined to be the crewâ€™s inability to prevent the aircraft from contacting the runway in an unsafe manor by not being able to correct the effect of unstable airflow on final.

Investigation Results Related to Possible Causes
1. After descending through an altitude of 250 feet, B7695 encountered unstable airflow three times, causing the descent rate to vary by more than 500 feet per minute. Five seconds before landing, it encountered downdraft again. Approximately two seconds before landing, the pilot applied elevator control, but due to insufficient altitude to correct the error, the aircraft landed at a descent rate of 28 feet per second, resulting in a hard landing that damaged both the left and right landing gear and caused the aircraft to drag on its belly.

2. The B7 695 pilot was insufficiently alert to the situation and failed to respond promptly when encountering unstable airflow.

Risk-Related Findings
1. UNI Air had no records of wind shear training for pilots other than simulator training. Low-altitude gust training for Runway 06 at Kinmen Airport was not included in special airport training, resulting in pilots not being familiar with handling unstable airflow.

2. During approach, the pilot failed to inform the non-pilot pilots of the procedures and precautions for encountering unstable airflow, failing to effectively utilize all available resources.

3. The original DASH8 manufacturer's (de HAVILLAND) Operating Data Manual and Flight Manual do not include operating procedures and techniques for wind shear.

4. UNI Air's flight operations manual did not specify a ""standard call"" procedure for handling wind shear, resulting in the pilot not using the standard call procedure for wind shear.

5. The pilot and cabin crew were insufficiently alert to the presence of smoke in the cabin and failed to declare and execute emergency evacuation procedures. The pilot also failed to notify the control tower of the presence of heavy smoke in the cabin, hindering the airport's emergency response timeline.

6. The co-pilot failed to use emergency means to open the cockpit door when it became stuck, thus delaying the time limit for emergency exit from the cockpit.

7. When heavy smoke formed in the cabin, the cabin crew failed to press the ""Emergency Call"" button to call the flight crew as required. The flight crew also failed to respond to the cabin crew's call, preventing them from promptly identifying the cabin emergency and addressing the situation.

8. The DASH 8-300 aircraft cabin is not equipped with smoke masks, and civil aviation regulations do not specify the number and placement of smoke masks, which affects the cabin crew's ability to respond to smoke in the cabin.

9. The cabin crew failed to follow procedures to locate the source of the smoke and failed to obtain a fire extinguisher. This was not in compliance with the company's ""Service Department Work Instructions,"" resulting in a lapse in safety measures.

10. UNI Air failed to conduct coordinated emergency evacuation training for pilots and cabin crew. The communication and cooperation between the pilots and cabin crew during this incident were not at a familiar level.

11. The competent authority lacks dedicated cabin safety inspectors to conduct cabin safety audits, and flight operations inspectors are tasked with doing so concurrently, resulting in inadequate cabin safety supervision.

12. The operating procedures for the closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitors at Kinmen Airport Control Station are not included in the station's ""Operations Manual,"" making it easy for errors to occur.

13. Kinmen Airport's control tower controllers were unable to see the Runway 06 landing zone from their workstations, and were using closed-circuit television to monitor aircraft movements in the area. However, this information was not announced in the Taipei Flight Information Region Flight Guide, leaving operators unaware of the situation.

14. Within the control area of â€‹â€‹Kinmen Shangyi Airport, 13 obstacles exceeded the restricted height, and three structures were located within the restricted construction zone. Uncovered trenches existed within the runway and taxiway areas, which did not comply with the ""Civil Aviation Airport Civil Facilities Design Standard Specifications."" The Civil Aviation Administration's relevant business units failed to communicate and coordinate effectively, resulting in the failure to disclose flight-related information in accordance with relevant regulations, posing a potential threat to flight safety.

15. The Civil Aeronautics Administration failed to identify certain information in the ""Taipei Flight Information Region Flight Guide,"" such as information on loading and unloading services at Kinmen Shangyi Airport, which was inconsistent with current conditions. This suggests a lack of effective oversight mechanisms.

16. Kinmen Shangyi Airport's perimeter and barrier facilities are incomplete, allowing for repeated intrusions by people and animals, posing a threat to flight safety.

17. The height of the obstacle surrounding the wind direction and anemometer at the runway head of Kinmen Shangyi Airport (Shangyi Airport) 06 does not meet ICAO clearance standards, resulting in measurement errors. The failure to establish an effective mechanism for communication and feedback from weather data users prevented early detection of the measurement errors.

Other Survey Findings
1. The pilot held a valid license in accordance with current civil aviation regulations.

2. Pilots must complete relevant training in accordance with current civil aviation regulations.

3. The driver's work and rest were normal within 72 hours prior to the accident; there is no evidence that he was under the influence of physical, psychological, drugs, or alcohol at the time of the accident.

4. The aircraft has implemented all airworthiness directives and is in airworthy condition.

5. The aircraft's load and balance are within the limits.

6. All damage to the aircraft structure was caused by external forces and overload.

7. The pilot's response and flight operations from the moment the aircraft encountered downdraft again 5 seconds before landing to the moment of landing were normal.

8. The competent authority, in approving a maintenance plan based on the aircraft manufacturer's maintenance requirements, failed to identify that the flight recorder system's periodic inspections did not comply with ICAO standards.

9. The aircraft's flight recorder's power supply was cut off by the acceleration inertia switch during the accident, preventing the recording of important data required for the investigation and hampering the investigation.

10. The DASH8 flight recorder does not record time parameters. While Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) can be inferred from parameters such as the synchronization character, VHF key, and radar time, the power outage in the ""Frame Counter"" caused some parameters to become distorted, resulting in errors in the recorded time parameters and affecting the investigation. This does not comply with Article 104 of the Civil Aviation Law and the standards of ICAO Annex 6.

Recommendations:

To UNI Air
1. Strengthen pilot training on wind shear alertness and handling procedures, including wind shear recognition, judgment, standard calls, operating procedures, crew coordination, and task allocation.
(ASR-02-02-001)

2. Establish standard call-out procedures for wind shear conditions encountered during approach and landing.
(ASR-02-02-002)

3. Require pilots to strictly follow instructions; include special precautions when issuing approach/landing instructions in adverse weather conditions. (ASR-02-02-003)

4. Strengthen pilot and cabin crew training on cabin smoke alertness and procedures. (ASR-02-02-004)

5. Review emergency protocols, procedures, and training, including emergency communication between the cockpit and cabin, the use of cockpit emergency equipment, emergency exit procedures, pilot and cabin crew understanding of emergency evacuation, decision-making, timing of announcements, and execution procedures. (ASR-02-02-005)

6. Develop procedures and standard call instructions to ensure pilots promptly provide relevant information to air traffic control personnel when encountering abnormal conditions such as tire blowouts, landing gear failure (or possible landing gear issues resulting in steering or braking difficulties), and cabin smoke, to facilitate subsequent handling. (ASR-02-02-006)

To the Civil Aviation Administration of China, Ministry of Transportation and Communications
1. Correct any non-compliant structures within Kinmen Shangyi Airport, including prohibited or restricted structures, super-high obstacles, uncovered trenches within runway and taxiway zones, and airport perimeter and barrier structures. Situations that cannot be corrected or have not yet been completed, as well as visual obstructions between the airport control tower and the runway, should be listed in the Taipei Flight Information Region Flight Guide.
(ASR-02-02-007)

2. Revise the inconsistencies in the Taipei Flight Information Region Flight Guide and establish effective mechanisms to prevent similar incidents. (ASR-02-02-008)

3. Eliminate visual barriers between the control tower and the runway at Kinmen Shangyi Airport and develop standard operating procedures for the closed-circuit television surveillance system. (ASR-02-02-009)

4. Re-examine the relevant operational procedures and protocols for the activation of the ""crash alarm"" by relevant units within Kinmen Shangyi Airport. (ASR-02-02-010)

6. Improve the installation environment for the wind direction and anemometer at the runway head 06, in accordance with ICAO Document 8896. (ASR-02-02-012)

7. Establish a maintenance plan review basis for periodic inspections of recorder systems, in accordance with Section 6.3 of Annex VI of the International Civil Aviation Organization and U.S. FAA Advisory Circular No. 20-141. (ASR-02-02-013)

8. Evaluate the removal of regulations related to acceleration inertia switches. (ASR-02-02-014)

9. Re-evaluate organization and management to enhance the capabilities and performance of relevant departments (units) in internal coordination and communication, oversight mechanisms, and the development and management of civil aviation regulations. (ASR-02-02-015)

To aircraft manufacturers (de Havilland Canada)
1. The DASH-8 aircraft operating manual specifies the aircraft's performance, characteristics, operating procedures, techniques, and optimal configuration settings when encountering or potentially encountering wind shear, as a guide for pilots to follow when encountering or potentially encountering wind shear. (ASR-02-02-016)

The landing gear was retracted and deployed several times and performed satisfactory. Prior to being released to the leasing company a test flight was made. During an instrument approach the landing gear was selected down, but the right hand undercarriage did not lock down. The crew recycled the gear and again the right hand main gear came down but failed to lock.
The 'alternate gear extension' procedure was followed but it again failed to lock.
Upon landing the right had undercarriage collapsed.

The final report of the investigation did not conform to ICAO Annex 13 standards and did not contain a Probable cause.
It was noted that the hydraulic swivel assembly was connected upside down. This caused the swivel to bend when the landing gear was lowered, preventing it from locking down.

16 Nov 2002,de Havilland Canada DHC-8-315Q Dash 8,VH-SBT,QantasLink,0,"near Mackay, QLD (MKY)",non,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/190893,Dash 8-300,DH8C,15:03,580,P&W Canada PW123,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants:,0,Serious incident,Unknown,Passenger - Scheduled,"Townsville-Garbutt Airfield, QLD (TSV/YBTL)","Mackay Airport, QLD (MKY/YBMK)","A DHC-8-315 (Dash 8) was being operated on a scheduled service to Mackay from Townsville under the instrument flight rules (IFR). The crew had been authorised by Brisbane Centre air traffic control to descend their aircraft to 6,000 ft. The duty runway at Mackay was 14 and, at 1503:00 Eastern Standard Time, the crew reported that they were tracking on the 304 degree radial of the Mackay VHF omni-directional radio range (VOR) navigation aid and were 30 NM from Mackay. The Mackay aerodrome controller (ADC) instructed the crew to `Report approaching 6,000 ft with DME [distance measuring equipment] distanceâ€™.

An IFR category Boeing 717-200 (717) was being operated on a scheduled service to Mackay from Brisbane. Its crew reported at 1503:22 that they were tracking on the 130 degree radial of the Mackay VOR, also on descent to 6,000 ft. The Brisbane Centre controller had assigned both crews 6,000 ft prior to instructing them to transfer to the Mackay ADC radio frequency. The assignment of the same level was an authorised practice, because the Brisbane Centre controller would continue to radar monitor the separation of all arriving aircraft until the first aircraft was at or below 5,000 ft. The ADC subsequently instructed the 717 crew to descend to 4,000 ft. The crew asked whether they could expect a left base and the ADC responded saying that they could expect a left base to runway 14.

The Dash 8 was in cloud, and at 1506:17 the ADC instructed that crew to descend to 4,700 ft. There was no separation standard being applied between the Dash 8 and the 717 and separation was no longer assured. The infringement of separation was not recognised by the Mackay ADC. The ADC instructed the 717 crew to descend to 3,000 ft and to reduce speed. The crew was told that they were number two to a Dash 8 from the north and the ADC asked them to report when visual. The Dash 8 crew reported approaching 4,700 ft at 14 DME and was instructed to descend to 2,000 ft, not below the DME steps.

At 1507:53, the crew of the 717 reported visual at 7 NM and advised that they were able to track for left base. The ADC told them to maintain 3,000 ft and to track for left downwind. The crew was asked to sight a helicopter in front of them at 2,000 ft and 4 miles east of the aerodrome. The crew replied `for the base runway 14 and lookingâ€™.

The crew of the Dash 8 reported visual (clear of cloud) and was cleared to make a visual approach straight in to runway 14 at 1508:38. The crew of the 717 was cleared for a visual approach at 1508:51. The crew of the 717 responded by reading back the clearance. The controller then said `and maintain downwind heading, the Dash 8â€™s currently at 9 mileâ€™. The 717 crew neither heard, nor responded to, this subsequent transmission. The ADC did not query the lack of acknowledgment of that requirement.

Approximately 90 seconds later, the ADC observed the 717 turning left base and converging with the Dash 8 on final approach. This was a second, and more critical, infringement of separation between the two aircraft.

The crew of the Dash 8, on final approach, observed the 717 turn onto base towards their aircraft. The ADC instructed the crew of the Dash 8 to turn right, away from the 717. The ADC issued traffic information to the 717 crew who, after sighting the Dash 8, elected to maintain 1,500 ft. The ADC confirmed with the Dash 8 crew that they could see the 717 and authorised them to continue the approach. The ADC subsequently instructed the crew of the 717 to climb to 2,000 ft and make a left circuit before returning for landing.

SIGNIFICANT FACTORS
1. The ADC did not separate the 717 and Dash 8 using procedural separation standards before the aircraft were separated visually.
2. The 717 crew did not hear the sequencing instruction for them to maintain a downwind heading.
3. The controller did not obtain a readback of the sequencing instruction for the 717 crew to maintain a downwind heading.
4. The controller did not provide the 717 crew with accurate traffic information about the Dash 8

They contacted Seattle-Tacoma Tower when they were near Elliot Bay, and were cleared to land on Runway 16 Right, number two behind a 737 that was then touching down. Because of the distance between their position and the preceding 737, neither flight crew member saw the aircraft they were sequenced behind. The Captain, who was flying at the time, therefore aligned the aircraft with what he felt sure was Runway 16 Right. He then continued on the approach, and completed what to him seemed to be an uneventful landing. Soon after the aircraft touched down, the tower advised the flight crew that they had landed on Taxiway Tango. The Captain said that when they lined up on final approach, there was an overcast over the approach end of the runway (which was dry), bright sunshine to the south of the airport, and a glare on the runway surface. According to him, this caused the area around the approach end of the runway to appear as one dark color (shadow), making it hard to differentiate between Runway 16 Right and Taxiway Tango. He further stated that he had been into Seattle-Tacoma Airport many times before, and was aware of the large ""X"" just off the north end of Taxiway Tango. But, according to the Captain, because of the contrast between the runway glare and the dark area around the approach end, he did not notice that he had flown over the ""X"" just prior to touching down on the taxiway.

Probable Cause: The flight crew's misidentification of the parallel taxiway as the active runway, resulting in the flight crew executing a landing on the taxiway. Factors include sun glare and shadows around the runway/taxiway environment, and visual illusions created by the airport surface environment.

After take-off, at about 3000 feet above sea level, the aircraft banked left and force had to be applied on the steering wheel to keep the wings level. The checklist for a runaway aileron trim tab was completed, which corrected the situation. However, the flight crew found that the trim tab indication, which was fully to the right, was not normal. Emergency services were requested and the aircraft continued on its flight to QuÃƒÂ©bec. On final approach for Runway 24 at QuÃƒÂ©bec, the crew was advised by the controller that the airline required it to not continue with the approach. A missed approach was executed and it was suggested to the captain that he come back for a no-flaps landing. The aircraft came back and landed with no flaps without incident at 1052 eastern standard time.

At the time, both aircraft were being operated in instrument meteorological conditions in cloud and conditions conducive to icing. Examination of flight data recorder information suggested that the pitot heads had become blocked, most probably by ice, preventing air pressure being sensed by the instruments.

Contributing safety factors:
- There was inadequate pitot head maintenance guidance regarding the continuing airworthiness of the pitot head and associated electrical system. [Safety issue]
- Although serviceable and selected on, the electric pitot heating elements were not able to prevent the build up of ice over the pitot head.
- DHC8-315, VH-SBJ, suffered a dual airspeed indication failure due to both pitot systems becoming blocked by ice while VH-SBW suffered a single airspeed indication failure due to one pitot system being blocked by ice.
- Both the operator’s and the manufacturer’s QRH for the DHC8-300 did not contain adequate guidance for the flight crew to resolve the abnormal operation of the aircraft systems.[Safety issue]

Just as the pilot was considering aborting the takeoff above the rotation speed, the aircraft slowly became airborne. After takeoff the pilot exercised the aircraft pitch controls whereupon the control forces returned to normal. The pilot then decided to continue to Manchester where an uneventful landing was made. The cause of the high control forces in pitch were probably due to frozen spring tabs caused either by incomplete de-icing before flight, or by rehydration of the de-icing fluid residue. The aircraft manufacturer has subsequently issued two All Operators Messages applicable to Dash 8 series 100, 200 and 300 aircraft following two instances of a rejected takeoff in the Dash 8 series 200 aircraft due to the inability to rotate at the appropriate rotate speed. The AOMs cite as a potential cause the restriction of the spring tabs due to freezing of rehydrated de-icing fluid residue, and recommends periodic washing of specific aerodynamically â€œquietâ€ areas to remove this residue.

The aircraft, a DHC-8-300, operated a domestic service to Tambacounda. After midnight on February 6, the flight was cleared to land on runway 6. The airplane touched down hard and went off the left side of the runway. It ran over a trench, causing the left hand main undercarriage leg to collapse. The airplane came to rest on uneven terrain at the side of the runway.

Probable cause of the accident (translated from French):
- Poor weight and balance assessment reported to the Pilot-in-command prior to take-off.
During the flight from Dakar to Tambacounda this was not felt because the autopilot was engaged.
On approach, the autopilot disengaged and induced an alteration of the speed parameters.
To maintain the altitude, the pilot was obliged to increase the power resulting in a speed higher than that recommended, with poor control of the airplane in short final.
- After the runway excursion, the plane's contact with the trenches and sand piles caused by works, contributed to the degradation of certain parts of the aircraft.

Shortly after the Ground Power Unit (GPU) cables had been disconnected from the aircraft, and with nobody in the
cab, the GPU moved forward and struck the rotating propeller on the right engine before coming to rest against the fuselage. All the occupants exited the aircraft through the passenger door and no one was injured.
The right propeller had suffered significant damage to all four blades and to its hub. The right engine had come to an abrupt halt and, as a result, the engine required a complete overhaul.
Also, there was a dent in the fuselage with associated local damage to the fuselage structure.

Conclusions:
The incident occurred because the GPU was being operated with a worn ball joint on the governor rod, a worn fuel pump spring and a worn gate in the forward-neutral-reverse selector.
These three mechanical defects are attributed to:
a) Inadequacies in the operator's maintenance system, including defect reporting.
b) The lack of appropriate checks in the manufacturer's recommended servicing schedule

The aircraft landed with the nose landing gear (NLG) up, both NLG doors open and the main landing gear (MLG) down and locked. The aircraft was evacuated on the runway. There were no injuries.


Cause
The cause of the accident was the inability to extend the front landing gear, which was jammed after slush, which had entered the wheel well while landing on a contaminated runway at Pamplona airport, froze into several pieces of ice.
The slush was not detected during the pre-flight inspection made prior to takeoff

There were no injuries among the 51 occupants.
The airplane landed on runway 15 at Governor's Harbour following a flight from Nassau. On touchdown the left hand main landing gear separated. The airplane skidded and came to rest on the runway.

Probable Cause:
Probable Cause has been determined as an over-center Torque Link condition that culminated in a single cycle failure of the cylinder. The over center torque links condition occur as a result of the over extension of the shock strut.

Possible Contributory factors to the over extension of the shock strut includes:
Possible Cause for Loss of Damping
- The failure to install the dampening ring when the landing gear was assembled.
- Improper servicing of the landing gear shock strut with Mil-H-5606 hydraulic fluid plus nitrogen during initial assembly.
- Improper servicing of landing gear shock strut during line maintenance and inadequate post servicing follow up per AMM Chapter 12. See attached report Appendix A-30 From Bombardier
- Under-serviced shock strut (low oil volume)
- A broken damper ring
- No damper ring
- Disengaged damper ring

When the landing gear was selected to the extended position, the main landing gear extended properly but the nose landing gear did not. The crew performed a go-around, exited the airport airspace, and unsuccessfully attempted to extend the nose landing gear using several checklists and in consult with ground-based maintenance personnel. A subsequent fly-by of the air traffic control tower confirmed that the nose landing gear doors were open, but that the nose landing gear was not extended. The captain subsequently landed the airplane with the nose landing gear retracted and delayed lowering the nose until the slowest speed possible. The nose of the airplane contacted the runway and the airplane slid for about 525 feet before it stopped. There was no fire, and the passengers deplaned normally at the scene. On-site examination of the airplane and a laboratory examination of the nosegear components revealed that the steering links had been circumferentially loaded in tension beyond their load-carrying capacity. Failure of the steering links allowed the nosewheels to rotate in the wheel well and become wedged within the structure. Hardness testing satisfied the manufacturer's minimum requirements and no determination could be made as to when the overload occurred.

Probable Cause: The mechanical overload of the nosewheel steering links for undetermined reasons, which resulted in nose landing gear rotation and its subsequent wedging within the wheel well structure.

Shortly thereafter the flightcrew noticed a layer of clouds ahead and asked air traffic control (ATC) if they could climb to stay above the clouds. The controller was unable to clear the airplane to climb due to traffic above. The captain informed the flight attendant (FA) who began beverage service to put the cart away and be seated due to anticipated turbulence. The flight entered a cloud layer and was then vectored by ATC 80 degrees to the right to a navigation fix. During the turn, the first officer noticed a small cell of precipitation directly ahead of their flight path. The first officer continued the turn 30 more degrees to avoid the cell but the flight encountered about 15 seconds of moderate turbulence. The beverage cart and the flight attendant became airborne, and when she landed she sustained compound fractures of her left tibia and fibula. She alerted the captain and two passengers assisted the injured FA by securing the beverage cart. The injured FA continued to make all required safety announcements.

When the pilots moved the landing gear selector lever to DOWN, the left and right main landing gear legs extended normally, but the nose landing gear stopped before it had fully extended, probably because debris within the hydraulic fluid blocked a small orifice in the hydraulic ram (actuator) that extended and retracted the nose landing gear.
The primary system that indicated the status of the landing gear showed the pilots that the landing gear was 'unsafe', that the nose landing gear was not down and locked, and that the nose landing gear forward doors were open.
The pilots began working through a checklist to troubleshoot the problem. The checklist directed them to an independent verification system designed to show whether the individual landing gear legs were locked down. That system showed the pilots 3 green lights, which verified that all the landing gear was down and locked, in spite of the other indications that the nose landing gear was not.
The pilots assumed that there was a fault in one of the landing gear sensors and continued the approach to land at Woodbourne in the expectation that all of the landing gear was locked down. On the final approach the landing gear warning horn sounded when the pilots began to configure the aeroplane for landing by selecting the wing flaps to 15 degrees. This warning horn was designed to alert the pilots that the landing gear was not safe. A short time later the ground proximity warning system also alerted the pilots that the landing gear was not locked down. The pilots ignored both of these warnings in the belief that they had been generated from a single sensor that they assumed was faulty and had given them the original unsafe nose landing gear indications.
When the aircraft touched down and the pilot lowered the nose, the nose landing gear was pushed into the wheel well and the aeroplane completed the landing roll skidding on the nose landing gear doors. Damage to the aeroplane was minimal and no-one was injured.

Prior to taking off from Hamilton, the nosewheel steering malfunctioned because an ""inhibit switch"" in the cockpit was faulty. The faulty switch caused a loss of hydraulic pressure to the nosewheel steering. The nosewheel steering system was considered non-essential, so in accordance with the approved Minimum Equipment List, the aeroplane departed Hamilton with the system inoperative. The trip towards Wellington was uneventful.

The nosewheel steering hydraulic power came from the extend side of the landing gear hydraulic system. On the approach to Wellington, none of the landing gear extended when it was selected down. The pilots carried out a go-around to give them time to perform the relevant procedures provided in a Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). The Q300 was fitted with an alternative system for lowering the landing gear when the normal system failed. The ""Alternate Gear Extension"" procedure succeeded in getting the main landing gear to extend, but not the nose landing gear. That remained locked in its retracted position.

There was nothing mechanically wrong with the alternate landing gear extension system. The nose landing gear did not extend because the pilots did not pull hard enough on the handle that should have released the uplock. If the uplock had released, the nose landing gear would have lowered under gravity and locked down.

The pilots decided to divert to Woodbourne Aerodrome and to land with the nose landing gear retracted. No-one was injured in the landing. The damage to the aeroplane was confined to the area around the nose landing gear and the lower forward fuselage.

The Minimum Equipment List appeared to have considered the operational consequences only of allowing a Q300 to depart with inoperative nosewheel steering. The link between a failure of the nosewheel steering and a potential failure in the hydraulic system, which would affect the landing gear, did not appear to have been considered. The manufacturer has since amended the Minimum Equipment List to require a check of the hydraulic system pressure before allowing a departure with the nosewheel steering inoperative.

The operator's pilots were not made aware through their training of how hard one had to pull the handle to release the nose landing gear uplock. A much lesser pull was required when practising the procedure in the operator's flight simulator and the Alternate Gear Extension procedure did not, at the time, give any guidance as to the force required.

There were no fatalities.
The airplane operated on a flight from Kigoma (TKQ) to Tabora (TBO) and Dar Es Salaam (DAR).
Initial reports say the airplane overran the runway on takeoff. The right hand undercarriage apparently stuck a muddy pot hole. The right hand wing separated inboard of the no. 2 engine. The engine then twisted upside down and to the side, causing the front of the engine to penetrate the fuselage at the underwing emergency exit."

06:45 LT on a scheduled 35-minute passenger flight, to Das Island Airport (OMAS) with 49 persons on-board. After several minutes in flight, and before reaching 5,000 feet, a passenger informed the cabin crew member about signs of paint blisters on the right hand engine inboard panel, as seen through the cabin window.
The passenger's observation was confirmed by the co-pilot who informed the captain of a possible engine fire. A PAN was declared and Abu Dhabi air traffic control (ATC) gave an immediate clearance for landing. Cockpit indications were normal but the crew decided to return to the airport due to the possibility of an engine fire. Unknown to the crew and passengers, the same condition also existed on the left hand engine.
The aircraft landed uneventfully and the airport fire service confirmed that there was no sign of fire. No injury was reported among the passengers or crew members.

Causes:
The Air Accident Investigation Sector determines that the cause, of this incident, which resulted in an 'in-flight turn back', was due to the omission to reinstall the left engine igniters on both of the aircraftâ€™s engines following maintenance work. The maintenance error occurred as result of a number of contributing factors.

The Contributing factors to the event were:
(a) Unrecorded maintenance work performed on the Aircraft by the Operatorâ€™s maintenance personnel.
(b) Introduction of an engine wash without a maintenance task card.
(c) Engineer signed off work on the aircraft without verifying that the work had been performed.
(d) Mechanics performed unsupervised work.
(e) Mechanics performed engine motoring without the Operatorâ€™s approval.
(f) Work was performed on the aircraft without maintenance task card.
(g) Engine washes were not considered a critical task by the Operator.
(h) Performing similar tasks on both engines during the same maintenance visit.
(i) Not carrying out an engine run after the engine washes were performed
(j) Not performing a system check of the engine ignition system after engine wash normalization.
(k) Not attaching a telltale streamer to indicate that parts have been removed and are in a concealed area.
(l) Operatorâ€™s quality oversight, as unrecorded work was being performed regularly prior to the Incident.
(m) Mechanics not signing for work performed, following engine washes.
(n) The removal, in 2009, of the engine wash card which was requiring a signature by the mechanic, before the engineer signoff.
(o) The effect of fatigue on the decision making process of the Engineer due to his shift pattern of working an average of 8.5 hours a day for 32 days with 2 staggered days off.
(p) The Engineer, in addition to supervising the shift work, was required to enter data into the Operatorâ€™s electronic system.
(q) Application of the Operatorâ€™s human factors training, as unrecorded work was a practice associated with engine washes.
(r) The Operatorâ€™s SMS implementation, since there were GCAA audit findings between 2009 and 2012.
(s) Lack of guidance provided by the GCAA, and the Operator, of the effect of shift duty times, and management of the risk associated with fatigue.

It was the first of 4 flights planned on that day for the crew. At 14:27 local time the aircraft left took off with 32 passengers and 3 crew members. The co-pilot was the pilot flying (PF), and the pilot-in-command was the pilot monitoring (PM).
Cruising at 14 000 feet above sea level (asl), the crew received clearance from air traffic control to perform a contact approach on runway 29 at GaspÃ©. At 14:03 local time the PF began the descent and headed directly toward the OVUBI final approach fix, located 5.5 nautical miles (nm) from the threshold of runway 29.
At 14:10, the aircraft intercepted the final approach 5 nm from the runway, at a height above touchdown zone elevation of about 2400 feet and a speed of 138 knots. The aircraft reached the optimum descent angle of 3Â° from above and continued its approach, descending gradually below the slope indicated by the precision approach path indicator (PAPI). At approximately 170 feet, when the aircraft descended below the lower limit of the PAPI range (with 4 red lights visible), the pilot flying reduced power; the rate of descent increased, and the aircraft was aiming for the runway threshold. At about 45 feet, when the aircraft was 700 feet from the runway threshold, power was reduced to idle, and speed dropped to VREF +3 in deceleration.
At 14:12, the aircraft made a hard landing, during which the lower part of the aft fuselage came into contact with the runway and the ""Touched Runway"" indicator came on. The first wheel marks of the right main gear appeared at 109 feet from the threshold of runway 29.
After landing, the aircraft backtracked normally on the runway, taxied, and parked in front of the air terminal.
An examination of the aircraft revealed traces of the impact and scuff marks on the skin, structural stiffeners and longerons of the lower portion of the fuselage.
Depressions and deformations of the skin were observed on the lateral surfaces of the fuselage under the wings and under the tail unit.

Findings as to causes and contributing factors:
1. The application of a pronounced nose-up control to reduce the rate of descent resulted in a nose-high attitude. This attitude, combined with a hard landing that compressed the oleos, resulted in the aft part of the fuselage striking the runway, causing significant damage to the aircraft structure.
2. The pilot monitoring was focusing attention outside and did not identify the loss of energy in time to notify the pilot flying or to intervene and thereby prevent the hard landing.
3. The aircraft crossed the runway threshold with insufficient energy to stop the rate of descent with only an increase in the nose-up attitude at the time of the flare.
4. The crew had not received training on the technique recommended by the manufacturer in the event of a higher than normal rate of descent near the ground. As a result, the pilot flying did not limit the nose-up attitude or increase power to reduce the rate of descent, and the aircraft fuselage struck the runway.

There were no injuries to the three passengers or three crewmembers onboard and the aircraft was substantially damaged. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time. The flight had originated from Tarin Kowt Airport (TII), Afghanistan
According to the flight crew, the takeoff, climb and cruise were uneventful. The captain was the flying pilot. At 11:12 the flight was cleared for the approach and at 11:16 the flight crew selected flaps 35 and initiated a random steep approach in accordance with company task procedures as a result of the airport threat level. According to the flight crew statements, the airplane engine power was reduced to idle for the approach and was not increased prior to landing. Information obtained from Flight Data Recorder (FDR) indicated engine torque was at or near zero for the last 5 minutes of approach and landing.
The aviation routine weather report at 05:50 local time indicated wind from 120 degrees at 5 knots, 8000 meters visibility and temperature 17 degrees C. For the two minutes prior to landing, the wind was light and variable. A tactical meteorological observation system on the field reported the wind direction during the two minutes prior to landing as variable from 004 degrees to 137 degrees and the wind speed variable from 1 knot to 7.2 knots. Wind gust recorded during the time period varied from 050 degrees to 079 degrees at 7.0 to 7.2 knots.
Based on FDR data the calculated rate of descent was about 2,000 feet per minute during approach, reducing to about 1,500 feet per minute just prior to landing. The airplane touched down with a nose up pitch attitude of approximately 8 degrees and a peak vertical acceleration of 2.7g. The airplane geometry information provided by the manufacturer indicated that aft fuselage contact will result from a pitch attitude over 11.9 degrees with an extended landing gear oleo strut, and a pitch attitude over 6.8 degrees with a compressed landing gear oleo strut.
In order to avoid nuisance warnings resulting from the random steep approach (i.e. steep angle descent), the flight crew deactivated the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) for approach. As these alerts would be expected by the crew during this type of approach, it is unlikely the alerts would have prompted the crew to take corrective action.
The airplane touched down and contacted the aft fuselage on the runway resulting in substantial damage (including buckled, cracked, and bent frames and stringers).

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captains ineffective management of the airplanes energy state during final approach and flare that resulted in a hard landing and tail strike at touchdown."""

The crews of both FVH and TQZ discussed their respective positions and intentions and the crew of TQZ stated that they would advise FVH when they were about to take-off. When on downwind, approaching 3,000 ft in IMC, the captain of TQZ observed an aircraft on the TCAS, above. The captain identified the aircraft as FVH and instructed the first officer to stop the climb and turn the aircraft to the right. Shortly after, the crew received a TCAS traffic advisory (TA) and then an initial resolution advisory (RA) to descend, followed shortly after by an RA to â€˜adjust vertical speedâ€™. At the same time, while also in IMC, the crew of FVH also reported receiving a TCAS TA and then a TCAS RA to climb. The captain of FVH immediately responded and climbed the aircraft.

The captain, who was an instructor, sat in the right seat and the trainee in the left seat for training to obtain the type rating for First Officer certification in the Japan Coast Guard.
The final part of the training was a flap up landing at Sendai Airport, Japan. The captain and the trainee completed the flap up landing checklist just before the arrival at Yuriage (a visual reporting point of Sendai Airport) and the captain told the trainee that if the pitch angle (nose-up angle) exceeded 6Â°, corrective control would have to be performed by pushing the control column forward. Vref (reference speed for landing) was 126 kt. The aircraft entered the traffic pattern of runway 09 and landed around 15:58.
Although the trainee made the main landing gear touch down near the aiming point marking for the runway 09, he felt it took a great deal of time to lower the nose. This time the captain on the right seat pushed the control column forward since he feared a tail strike. Then the nose landing gear touched the ground with stronger impact than usual (+1.47 g). In. Both the captain and the trainee were not aware of irregularity of the aircraft in landing roll, therefore they continued taxi and the aircraft arrived at the apron at around 16:05.
After the engines were shutdown, the nose landing gear was found to be damaged in post-flight inspection by the on-board mechanic. Afterward, detailed inspection was conducted, which revealed abrasion marks on the lower part of the nose landing gear, damage on components of the nose landing gear, and deformation of the forward fuselage skins of the airframe.

PROBABLE CAUSES: ""In this accident, it is probable that the nose of the aircraft suddenly downed and the nose landing gear strongly touched down on the ground after the main landing gear touched the ground in the landing, therefore the components of the nose landing gear were damaged and the fuselage skins of the airframe was deformed.
Regarding the fact that the nose landing gear of the aircraft strongly touched the ground on the ground, it is probable that it was because that the captain who considered worry of tail contact performed the sudden and large control for moving the nose downward, when the nose-up attitude tended to be too excessive after the nose landing gear touched the ground once and the nose upped again.""

According to the operator, the flight was in smooth conditions during the cruise portion and initial descent. The Captain stated that as he finished the before-landing checklist at 4,000 feet, approximately 50 miles south of IAD, the flight encountered a ""pocket"" of moderate turbulence resulting in a descent rate of about 600 feet per minute and an altitude loss of about 400 feet.

At 10:57 local time, during the approach at Deer Lake, the flight crew selected the landing gear down; however, a weight on wheels caution light as well as advisory lights illuminated, indicating that the nose landing gear was not in the down-and-locked position. The flight crew executed a missed approach and entered a hold in order to troubleshoot the problem. At 12:02, the flight crew requested a diversion to Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador, and declared an emergency. At 12:30, the aircraft landed on runway 27 at Stephenville with the nose landing gear in a partially extended position. On touchdown, the nose landing gear fully collapsed, and the aircraft nose structure came into contact with the runway surface. The aircraft slid and came to a stop approximately halfway down the runway.
There were no injuries to passengers or crew.

Findings as to causes and contributing factors:
1. For undetermined reasons, a previous repair to the inner cylinder of the nose landing gear shock strut was not designated with a specific permanent marking as required by the approved component maintenance manual, resulting in the installation of a standard size bearing where an oversize bearing was required.
2. The reduced sealing force caused by the smaller-than-required bearing installation likely allowed the nose landing gear shock strut to leak.
3. The reduced hydraulic fluid volume, in addition to a possible nitrogen leak, reduced the internal static pressure of the nose landing gear shock strut and allowed it to partially compress when it was in the up position.
4. The airflow encountered in flight when the nose landing gear was lowered further compressed the nose landing gear shock strut and allowed the tires to impinge on the aft landing gear doors, thereby jamming the nose landing gear in a partially extended position.

The first aircraft in the sequence, an Airbus A320, was approaching from the south-west. The other two aircraft, both DHC-8-311s, were joining from the north-east.
When the first DHC-8 (ZK-NEH, flight RLK235) was parallel with the runway, the flight crew requested approval for a visual approach, rather than a full instrument procedure. This was approved and the aeroplane continued downwind to position behind the A320.
The DHC-8 (ZK-NEF, flight RLK285), following about two minutes behind the first, also requested a visual approach. This was approved to follow the first DHC-8. However, the second DHC-8 identified the A320 as the DHC-8, then turned towards the runway to position behind the A320. This put it into a conflicting flight path with the first DHC-8.

As the two DHC-8s approached each other, the air traffic controllers were alerted to a potential conflict by an automatic short-term conflict alert warning presented on their radar displays. The approach controller tried to resolve the conflict but could not contact the second DHC-8. They then contacted the Wellington tower controller. The Wellington tower controller broadcast a message to resolve the conflict. At about the same time the respective DHC-8 flight crews saw each other, and both took evasive action to ensure adequate separation was maintained. While taking this evasive action, the flight crews of both Dash-8s received automatically generated, traffic-collision-avoidance alert messages from their onboard systems that advised them to take evasive action to avoid conflict.

Both flight crews avoided the potential conflict and all three aircraft landed without further incident.

Why it happened
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the crew of LINK285 mistakenly identified another aeroplane in the sequence to land for the preceding aeroplane they had been instructed to follow. The Commission found that the flight crew had insufficient situational awareness in relation to their position in the circuit pattern before they took on the responsibility of maintaining their visual separation from the aeroplane ahead. The lighting and visual conditions prevailing at the time made it more difficult for the LINK285 flight crew to visually identify the preceding aeroplane, and they had not used other means they had available to validate their visual interpretation.
In addition, the Commission found that the automatic and human defences incorporated into the air traffic control and aircraft systems detected the potential conflict and prevented the situation escalating.
The Commission found three safety issues. Two safety issues were related to the situation where a flight operating under instrument flight rules changed to make a visual approach to land. The first of these was that critical information for a flight crew to conduct a visual approach was not required to be passed on to the flight crew. The second was that air traffic control procedures could create a situation where an approach controller would be unable to contact a flight crew when the controller was still responsible for monitoring that flight crewâ€™s compliance with an instruction. A third safety issue was that, after a serious incident, the operatorâ€™s current practice allowed potentially critical evidence contained in two separate aircraft cockpit voice recorders to be lost.

At about 06:15 local time VH-XKJ departed Perth Airport with two flight crew, two cabin crew and 51
passengers on board.
Shortly after take-off, as the aircraft was climbing through approximately 250 ft above ground level, the first officer (FO), who was the pilot monitoring, retracted the landing gear. At about this time, both flight crew detected a popping or banging sound from the vicinity of the number one (left) engine. The captain (pilot flying) also noted a slight left yaw through the flight controls. The FO observed a reduction in torque, to just below 60 per cent on the left engine. The FO reported a â€˜failureâ€™, but further advised â€˜itâ€™s not indicating a failureâ€™, as there was no associated master warning.
The captain reviewed the left engine instrumentation and noted that torque was 58 per cent. Other indications, such as fuel flow, appeared relatively normal. The captain then advised that, because the left engine was still producing some power, they would not shut it down, but would conduct a return to Perth. As the aircraft climbed through a height of approximately 800 ft, the flaps were retracted and the FO transmitted a PAN PAN call. Perth air traffic control acknowledged and the captain elected to return via a right circuit.
At about this time, the captain noted that the torque on the right engine was indicating lower than expected for the phase of flight. The captain advised the FO that they might need to upgrade to a MAYDAY. The throttles on both engines were then advanced to approximately 80-90 per cent, with both engines responding as expected. In addition, the banging sound in the left engine
ceased.
In preparation for landing, and to reduce airspeed, the throttles on both engines were retarded to about 30 per cent. The flight crew noted that, with this reduction in power, the banging sound in the left engine returned. Following a normal landing, the aircraft was taxied to the terminal, under power from both engines.

Findings
â€¢ Excessive erosion to the left engineâ€™s high-pressure turbine blades likely resulted in the power loss.
â€¢ At the time of the occurrence, the maintenance program for the detected erosion was in accordance with the manufacturer's maintenance manual requirements.
â€¢ The aircraft experienced an uncommanded gradual reduction of torque in the right engine, a mechanical issue with the engine as the cause was considered unlikely.

On the final approach and in accordance with the operational procedures decided by the Operator, the Commander took over the control of
the aircraft from the First Officer Candidate* due to a strong wind from the southwest, with wind gusts up to gale. The aircraft was stabilized in accordance with operational parameters down to about 30 feet RA (radio altitude). The approach speed then decreased markedly to below the minimum approach speed (Vref), together with an increase of the pitch attitude of the aircraft. This signified that during the touchdown of the aircraft, the aft fuselage of the aircraft got into contact with the runway, and the skin and structure of the aft fuselage were substantially damaged. The aircraft was taken to parking, and the passengers left the aircraft via the forward passenger door.
The accident occurred in daylight and under visual meteorological conditions (VMC).
The investigation revealed the following as a significant factor leading to the accident:
The Commanderâ€™s control input to the aircraft and lack of increase of engine effect resulted in a pitch attitude of app. +8.3Â°, and a low approach and touchdown speed."

This resulted in a loss of hydraulic fluid and loss of pressurization in the number two system. The loss of this system resulted in the rudder being dependent upon the sole remaining activation system (hydraulic system number one) for its operation. After the landing gear was lowered manually, the aircraft landed without further incident, but because the loss of the number two system rendered the nose wheel steering inoperative, the aircraft had to be towed from the runway. The reason for the failure of the hydraulic line could not be positively determined.

Probable Cause: The partial failure of one of the number two hydraulic system elevator hydraulic lines, leading to the loss of fluid and pressure in that system during cruise flight. This loss resulted in reliance upon the sole remaining activation system (number one hydraulic) to operate the rudder.

An Embraer EMB-145LU was also on a scheduled flight from Vienna to Basel. The DHC-8 was flying at flight level (FL) 240 and the EMB was descending to FL 320. After identification at 14:39 hrs by Munich Radar, the responsible controller informed the EMB that it could expect a further descent after passing Kempten. The standardised transfer altitude for approaches to Basel, FL 280, was already occupied and the controller coordinated FL 260. At 14:42:52 he issued the descent instruction: ""Descend to FL 260 at 2,000 ft/min or more"". The EMB crew repeatedly stated that they would descend to FL 230 at 1500 ft/min or more. The pilot did not notice this incorrect readback. Immediately afterwards, the controller instructed the transition to Zurich radar.

The co-pilot of the EMB had heard his commander repeat the instruction, but had not heard the controller's instruction. The crew of the DHC-8 ahead did not notice the incident. The Zurich Radar controller noticed that the EMB was descending to FL 230 and immediately instructed it to climb to FL 260, as the DHC-8 was at FL 240 immediately ahead of the EMB. Both aircraft were flying approximately the same heading at this time. At 14:47:19 hrs the closest distance to the DHC-8 ahead was 1.6 nautical miles and 400 ft vertically. The EMB then climbed back to FL 260. According to the responsible controller at the Munich DFS base, the traffic load was moderate at the time of the incident."

Before the flight crew could take any action, several of the birds impacted the nose of the aircraft and its windshield. The force of the impact shattered the inner-most pane of the windshield on the captainÂ’s side of the aircraft, and numerous small chunks of the glass hit the captain in the face and chest. The captain, who was cut by the glass in several places, turned control of the aircraft over to the first officer, who executed a successful landing at Medford about five minutes after the encounter. It was later determined that, in addition to the damage to the windshield, birds had penetrated the composite nose cone as well as the stressed metal skin immediately in front of the windshield.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The fracture and spalling of the inner-most pane of the aircraft's port side windshield while on a downwind for a night visual approach due to an imposed load beyond that required for windshield certification (multiple bird strikes). Factors include a dark night, and a flock of ducks (Lesser Scaups) flying in the location of the visual traffic pattern.""

When the aircraft landed on Runway 32 of Kochi Airport, the destination, the right main wheels ran off the side of the runway and the aircraft stopped there. There were 19 people on board, consisting of the pilot in command (PIC), three other crewmembers, and 15 passengers. There were no injuries.


PROBABLE CAUSE:
The causal factors to this serious incident are estimated as follows: When the aircraft landed during crosswind conditions at Kochi Airport, the nose wheels were centered and in caster mode; these conditions made it difficult to stop the aircraft heading drift to the right and the aircraft ran off the runway despite efforts made by the PIC and the first officer to correct the direction using rudder pedals, steering control handle, differential wheel brake and differential power.
With regard to the reason the nose-wheels were in caster mode, it is estimated that the steering function by SCU was lost temporarily due to the PICâ€™s operation of the steering control handle in excess of Â±8 degrees when he was attempting to stop the heading drift while the WOW sensors were detecting an â€œin-airâ€ condition or within one second after they had detected an â€œon-groundâ€ condition. Contributing to the PICâ€™s operation of the steering control handle in this manner is the companyâ€™s failure to train relevant flight crew using the manufacturerâ€™s advisory information on control of the aircraft.
With regard to the failure to stop the aircraft heading drift to the right despite the PICâ€™s corrective control measures using differential wheel brake and differential power, it is estimated that the PIC did not perform these operations appropriately. Contributing to this is the fact that the relevant descriptions in the companyâ€™s manuals were unclear and that appropriate training was not given by the company to the PIC for operations such as braking during landing roll.

The flight crew carried out the initial part of the smoke checklist procedure, declared an emergency and carried out a diversion. The cabin crew members donned smoke hoods, which caused appreciable communication difficulties, and prepared the cabin for an emergency landing. After landing, an emergency evacuation was carried out, without injury. The smoke was found to be the result of fatigue cracking of a compressor support member of the No 2 engine. This had led to damage to an oil seal, allowing oil to leak into the bleed air supplying one of the air conditioning units. Fleet modification action aimed at preventing fatigue cracking of the component and at improving the affected oil seal was completed on all of the operator’s fleet by July 2006. No means of rapidly ascertaining the source of the smoke was available to the crew. Carrying out the subsequent actions prescribed in the checklist would have stopped the supply of smoke but the procedure was relatively protracted and could not be completed because of a high flight crew workload associated with the diversion.

The rear fuselage contacted the runway, resulting in a structural crack accompanied by a skin scrape on the underside of the aft cargo compartment.


Findings Related to Probable Causes
- The captain did not effectively use aircraft attitude and thrust to maintain the appropriate approach speed and rate of descent.
- The first officer failed to appropriately provide deviation callouts to the captain according to standardized communication procedures.
- Although the aircraft deviated from the stabilized approach criteria, the captain did not initiate a go-around.

Findings Related to Risk
- The flight crew of Flight 502 fell below the generally expected level of Crew Resource Management (CRM) performance.
- Jeju Air did not proactively obtain information regarding the captain's simulator training skills or qualifications and assigned him to operational flight experience training, thereby missing the opportunity to improve his proficiency.
- Jeju Air held its first instructor meeting to establish company flight technical standards only after the occurrence of the Flight 502 accident, three months after the company's founding, and decided on landing approach speeds without sufficient review by experts.
- The Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) program was not functioning properly due to the responsible staffâ€™s lack of awareness and excessive flight workloads.
- There was no standardized operational concept regarding landing reference speed (Vref) at Jeju Air, resulting in different understandings among flight crew members.
- Jeju Air's flight crew selection standards determined ranking but did not present a clear threshold for candidates who should not be selected.

15 Feb 2007,de Havilland Canada DHC-8-402Q Dash 8,G-JEDR,Flybe,0,Manchester International Airport (MAN/EGCC),min,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/72560,Dash 8-400 (Q400),DH8D,12:20,4087,P&W Canada PW150,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 43,0,Accident,Taxi,Passenger,Manchester International Airport (MAN/EGCC),,"A PIA Boeing 777-240LR (AP-BGY) and a Flybe DHC-8-402Q (G-JEDR) were involved in a ground contact accident at Manchester International Airport (MAN).

The DHC-8-400 had stopped short of the runway, at intersection Holding Position JA1, prior to taking off. The following Boeing 777 was cleared to Holding Position J1, at the beginning of the runway, which involved taxiing beyond JA1. The crew of the B777 were cautioned about the presence of the DHC-8 as they continued towards J1. As the B777 passed behind the DHC-8, its right wingtip struck the DHC-8’s rudder.
The B777 suffered minor scratching to its wingtip. The DHC-8’s rudder was damaged and required replacement.

AAIB Analysis
Whilst the crew of G-JEDR reported that they had stopped “on the line” at the holding position, analysis showed that if the aircraft had been stopped with its nose precisely above the relevant marking, and that AP-BGY had been following the taxiway centreline, the two aircraft would not have collided. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that G-JEDR had stopped a few metres short of the holding position, which was consistent with allowing the crew a view of the stop bar, as is normal aviation practice.
The decision by the commander of AP-BGY to deviate slightly from the taxiway centreline, as he passed G-JEDR, was to increase what he considered would be a small miss-distance between the two aircraft.
The method used by the GMC controller when directing departing aircraft for either full length or intersection departures, in order to present the Tower controller with opportunities to expedite the flow of traffic, was in accordance with normal ATC practice.
Both controllers had expected AP-BGY to hold short of the link to JA1, until G-JEDR had moved forward.
The clearances issued, for AP-BGY to taxi to J1, were correct. However, the cautions to the flight crew, which represented essential aerodrome information ‘to assist him [the pilot] in preventing collisions with parked aircraft’, as described in MATs Part 1, were not understood by them as meaning that there was a risk of a collision if they taxied past G-JEDR. The commander of AP-BFY stated that he believed that the instruction to taxi past G-JEDR would not have been
issued if a collision risk had existed.

13 Mar 2007,de Havilland Canada DHC-8-402Q Dash 8,JA849A,"All Nippon Airways - ANA, lsf Air Central Co.",0,Kochi Airport (KCZ),sub,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/321988,Dash 8-400 (Q400),DH8D,10:54,4106,Pratt & Whitney Canada PW150A,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 60,0,Accident,Landing,Passenger - Scheduled,Osaka-Itami Airport (ITM/RJOO),Kochi Airport (KCZ/RJOK),"A DHC-8-402Q Dash 8, JA849A, sustained substantial damage in a landing accident at Kochi Airport (KCZ), Japan. There were 56 passengers and four crew members on board. There were no injuries.
All Nippon Airways flight 1603 took off from Osaka (ITM) at 08:21 on a regular domestic flight to Kochi. At 08:47 the flight was given clearance to land on runway 32. However, when configuring the aircraft for landing, it appeared that the nose landing gear would not deploy. The approach was abandoned and the airplane entered a holding pattern. The crew members attempted to deploy the nose undercarriage but the attempts failed. Two low passes were flown, at 500 feet over the runway. The crew then attempted to extend the nose landing gear by utilizing acceleration force during a steep turn. When this did not work, a touch-and-go was made so as to apply an impact to the nose landing gear. The flight crew when concluded that they had to make a landing with the nose gear retracted.
The captain directed the cabin attendants to move some passengers to aft cabin and fire extinguishing agent was sprayed on the runway. At 10:54 a landing was carried out. The airplane sustained structural damage on the lower part of the forward fuselage.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""It is recognized that this accident was caused by that, in spite of gear down operations in flight by normal and alternative procedures, the nose landing gear could not be extended because the doors of the nose landing gear remained closed, and when the Aircraft landed in this configuration, the lower part of the forward fuselage contacted the runway surface and was damaged.
It is recognized that the doors of the nose landing gear remained closed because the spacer migrated out from the hinge part of the toggle link assy, which was part of the nose landing gear door linkage mechanism, interfered with the support fitting, thereby prevented the movement of the toggle link assy, which resulted in restraining the movement of the entire nose landing gear door linkage mechanism.
It is estimated that the spacer migrated out because the bolt, nut and the like were not installed, and the spacer was gradually pulled aft out of the toggle link assy under the influence of retractions/extensions of the nose landing gear, airframe vibration, aircraft acceleration and so on, during operations of the Aircraft. Regarding that the bolt, nut and the like were not installed, it is considered that these parts were not re-installed at the time of the repair in the manufacturing process of the Aircraft.""

Four of the 79 occupants suffered minor injuries.
Jeju Air flight 502 departed Jeju (Cheju) International Airport (CJU) at 08:49 for a domestic flight to Busan.
While the aircraft passing through an altitude of 9,500 feet, RUD CTRL caution lights and #2 RUD HYD caution lights illuminated. Accordingly, the pilots followed and carried out the procedures of QRH (Quick Reference Handbook).
According to the pilots, #2 RUD HYD caution lights illuminated constantly during the flight; however, RUD CTRL caution lights illuminated intermittently. As it reached a cruising altitude of 15,000 feet, the pilots notified the condition of malfunctions and actions taken according to the QRH to a mechanic stationed at the Gimhae Airport.
The pilots received a clearance from the Gimhae Approach Control for ILS runway 36L then circling approach to runway 18R.
While turning downwind for the circling approach, the caution lights of Elevator Feel, RUD CTRL, Pitch Trim and other warning lights illuminated on the caution and warning lights panel. However, the pilots stated that they couldnÂ’t recall all the caution lights illuminated at the time, and did not take any measures considering the illuminating lights as ""nuisance.""
The first officer who was Pilot Flying continued the circling approach, and aligned his aircraft with the runway 18R on the final approach course.
Wind direction/speed was 130 degrees at 13 knots gusting to 18 knots, ceiling 4,000 feet, and it was mostly cloudy.
From the point where the main landing gear touched down, the aircraft continued to drift left into the wind. Initially the pilots applied right rudder in an attempt to maintain runway center-line. Rather then apply left wing down, the control wheel input was toward the right.
As the captain kicked onto the rudder pedal and said, ""Why, why, Ah?"" and the first officer replied, ""it doesnÂ’t respond.""
As the nose landing gear touched down, and the pilots started to apply brakes. Then all of sudden, the deceleration rate dropped. The aircraft departed the left edge of the runway at 3,500 feet from the end of runway.
The aircraft collided into a concrete drainage ditch, which is located 340 feet away from the centerline of the runway 18R and 4,600 feet away from the end of runway, and then it came to rest.
When the aircraft stopped in the concrete drainage ditch, the pilots shut off the right engine, declared emergency to the air traffic control tower, and instructed the passengers to perform emergency evacuation.

CAUSES:
The Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board determines that the cause of the runway excursion of the Flight 502 was that the rudder failure was not recognized by the pilots during flight and as well as during landing roll.
Contributing to this accident was that 1) the rudder was failing to respond to the pilots' rudder pedal input and 2) After departing from the runway, no appropriate alternative measure was taken to control the aircraft direction.

On approach to Aalborg, the landing gear was selected down. When the landing gear extension sequence was completed, the cockpit indication for the landing gear indicated two green lights and one red light. The two green lights indicated that the left main landing gear and the nose landing gear were down and locked (safe). The red light indicated that the right main landing gear was not locked (unsafe). A go-around was initiated.
An alternate landing gear extension procedure was conducted but the cockpit indication for the right main landing gear remained unsafe.
A visual inspection of the landing gear was performed. The cabin was prepared for an emergency landing and the passengers were briefed.
The aircraft touched down on the left main landing gear, followed by the right main landing gear, and shortly thereafter the right main landing gear collapsed. The aircraft then departed the runway to the right and came to rest on the lower fuselage and right wing tip.
Investigators found that, due to severe corrosion of the threaded connection between the right MLG retraction/extension actuator piston rod and rod end, the separation of the actuator piston rod and rod end caused the malfunctioning of the right MLG. When selecting the landing gear to down position, the landing gear was released from the landing gear up-lock hook. Due to the separation of the rod end from the actuator piston, the right MLG extended in an undamped free fall condition. The kinetic energy cause the failure of the stabilizer brace link joint lugs. This failure rendered the stabilizer brace incapable of safety locking the right MLG in down position.

FACTORS:
1. There were no specified inspection tasks for inspection of the MLG retraction/extension actuator and rod end either in the MRBÂ’s report or in the Maintenance Requirement Manual in so far as ""L"", ""A"" and ""C"" checks.
2. The right and left MLG retraction/extension actuator piston and rod end were made of noble martensitic stainless steel and the less noble 4340 steel material, respectively.
3. Severe corrosion in the threaded connection between the right MLG actuator rod and rod end.
4. Separation of the right MLG retraction/extension actuator from the actuator piston rod end.
5. The right MLG stabilizer joint lugs failed.

The flight proceeded uneventfully until the final approach to Palanga. At an altitude of 2000 feet, the flight crew selected the landing gear down. However, the right-hand main gear extended but did not lock down and the landing gear doors did not close. The approach was aborted and the aircraft was positioned for another approach. The landing gear was recycled, but the warning remained.
The flight crew decided to divert to Vilnius Airport. Before landing at Vilnius, another attempt was made to release the undercarriage using a backup system, but the undercarriage control panel still showed unsafe the same warnings.
The no.2 (right) engine was shut down and the propeller was feathered prior to landing at Vilnius. When the plane touched down, right-hand main gear automatically retracted after a second. The no.1 engine was shut down and the aircraft slid off the side of the runway and stopped about 40 m to the right of the runway at 1150 m from the runway threshold.

Cause
The aircraft accident was caused by the separation of the piston rod of the extension/retraction actuator from the rod end during right hand main landing gear extension due to thread connection corrosion. The freely falling landing gear broke the apex hinge lugs of the stabilizer sections, the right hand landing gear did not lock in the extended position and collapse occurred when the aircraft was rolling after landing.

The aircraft, operating Lufthansa Regional flight LH4074 to Florence, Italy, returned to MÃ¼nchen when the nose landing gear could not be deployed in preparation for landing. Several attempts to recycle the landing gear proved fruitless. New attempts were made near MÃ¼nchen but these were also unsuccessful. Even the emergency procedure failed.
Finally a nose gear-up landing was carried out on runway 08R. The aircraft came to rest about 465 m after the nose contacted the runway.

Conclusions
The immediate causes of the accident were:
- Due to a vibration cracks developed and due to fretting a coil spring in the actuating mechanism for the nose landing gear doors broke.
- The fragments of the coil spring fell into the enclosed wheel well in the vicinity of the strut and jammed itself in the landing gear struts upon retraction of the nose gear.
- The jammed coil spring blocked the locking mechanisms of the nose landing gear in the retracted and locked position.
- The force required for releasing the blocked locking mechanisms could be applied to either the normal or with the emergency system.

27 Oct 2007,de Havilland Canada DHC-8-402Q Dash 8,LN-RDI,Scandinavian Airlines System - SAS,0,København-Kastrup Airport (CPH),sub,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/321848,Dash 8-400 (Q400),DH8D,16:53,4024,Pratt & Whitney Canada PW150A,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 44,0,Accident,Landing,Passenger - Scheduled,Bergen-Flesland Airport (BGO/ENBR),KÃ¸benhavn-Kastrup Airport (CPH/EKCH),"A de Havilland Canada DHC-8-402 Q400 passenger plane sustained substantial damage in a landing accident at Copenhagen (CPH), Denmark.
SAS Flight 2867 departed Bergen (BGO), Norway on a flight to Copenhagen (CPH), Denmark.
The en route and descent part of the flight were uneventful.
While the aircraft was descending through 1245 ft Radio Altimeter (RA), the landing gear was selected down. The landing gear indication was: nose landing gear (NLG) down and locked, left main landing gear (MLG) down and locked and right MLG in transit. A go around was initiated.
A few seconds later, the landing gear was selected up and the landing gear was up. The landing gear up indication was normal. Kastrup Tower was informed about the landing gear problem and that the aircraft was making a go around. The flight crew was instructed to contact Copenhagen Approach. In order to solve the landing gear problem, the flight crew requested radar vectors around the area.
The landing gear was selected down and the again the right main landing gear remained 'in transit'.
After contacting the operator's technical department it was decided to use the alternate landing gear extension procedure. Without success, the commander manually tried to pump the landing gear down.
The commander made a passenger briefing explaining that the landing would be an emergency landing and that the landing was expected in about half an hour.
During the approach the crew manually tried to pump the landing gear down, and again with success.
The flight crew decided to shut down the right engine. While the aircraft was passing through approximately 800 feet RA, the commander instructed the passengers to brace for impact.
Abeam taxiway B3, the aircraft left MLG touched down on runway 04R. After touch-down, the left engine was selected to reverse and the power was increased. The aircraft followed the runway centreline approximately 20 seconds. The aircraft right propeller, aft fuselage and right wingtip then made contact with the runway surface. The aircraft started to turn to the right and as it departed the runway it damaged two runway edge lights.

An examination identified a blocked orifice within the actuator assembly which prevented the complete extension of the right main landing gear. This finding is not related to the two previous accidents which occurred in September 2007, according to the Danish Accident Investigation Board.
The retraction/extension actuator restrictor valve was blocked with an O-Ring. The O-Ring was part of the solenoid sequence valve (SSV) which had been replaced on October 16. The O-Ring of the replaced part could have migrated into the landing gear hydraulic system. A mechanical sequence valve (MSV) blocked its way and the O-Ring was able to travel further to its final location in the right main landing gear retraction/extension actuator restrictor valve when this MSV was replaced on 22 October 2007.

The entire SAS fleet of DHC-8-400 planes had been grounded earlier following two similar accidents on September 9 and 12. Following an extensive inspection program and parts replacement, SAS began returning planes to service as of October 4, 2007. All aircraft were back in service on October 14.

On the accident flight on 27th October 2007 during extension of the Landing Gear, the right MLG extension fluid flow had enough flow to force a part of the damaged O-ring through the small orifice hole in the floating valve in the Retract Port Restrictor which blocked off the hydraulic fluid flow. The MLG Retraction/Extension Actuator was hydraulically locked by the blocked Retract Port Restrictor, which caused the right MLG to be stuck in the almost up position. In this situation, it was not possible to extend the right MLG.

One crew member and one passenger sustained minor injuries.
Flight SRK172 took off from Palma de Mallorca, Spain at 09:02 UTC for charter flight under IFR to Berne.
Pilot flying throughout the flight was a captain under supervision in the left seat with a training captain in the right seat as pilot not flying. The first officer, who also was still under check, sat on the jump seat and was in charge of radio communication at the end of the flight.
After an uneventful flight, the crew contacted Berne Arrival at 10:32 UTC. In Berne-Belp runway was 32 in operation. The ATCO asked the crew if they wanted to carry out a visual approach. The crew replied in the affirmative and requested an approach to runway 14, which was immediately granted.
During the flare of the aircraft just before touchdown, the crew noticed an above-average rate of descent. Pitch was increased to correct this. The aircraft then suffered a tail strike.

Causes (translated from German):
The accident is attributable to the fact that the aircraft touched down on the runway with the rear fuselage first, because the crew responded to a high rate of descent with too large a pitch angle instead of an increase in power.
Crew fatigue might have contributed to the accident.

Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.
Flight CJC3407 departed Newark-Liberty International Airport, NJ (EWR) at 21:20 on a domestic flight to Buffalo Airport, NY (BUF). At 22:15:14 the Buffalo Approach controller cleared the flight for an ILS approach to runway 23: ""Colgan thirty four zero seven three miles from klump turn left heading two six zero maintain two thousand three hundred till established localizer clear i l s approach runway two three."" The flight acknowledged that clearance.
At 22:16:02, the engine power levers were reduced to flight idle. At that time Buffalo Approach instructed the crew to contact Buffalo Tower. The crew extended the landing gear and the auto flight system captured the ILS 23 localizer. The captain then moved the engine conditions levers forward to the maximum RPM position as the copilot acknowledged the instructions to Buffalo Tower.
At 22:16:28 the crew moved the flaps to 10Â°, and two seconds later the stall warning stick shaker activated. The autopilot disconnected at about the same time that the stick shaker activated. The crew added power to approximately 75% torque. The airplane began a sharp pitch up motion, accompanied by a left roll, followed by a right roll, during which the stick pusher activated. During this time, the indicated airspeed continued to decrease to less than 100 kts. Eight seconds after the flaps had been selected to 10Â°, and at an airspeed of less than 110 kts, the crew retracted the flaps. Sixteen seconds later the flaps were fully retracted.
Following further pitch and roll excursions the airplane pitched down and entered a steep descent from which it did not recover. The airplane impacted a residential house and was destroyed.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the captainÂ’s inappropriate response to the activation of the stick shaker, which led to an aerodynamic stall from which the airplane did not recover. Contributing to the accident were (1) the flight crewÂ’s failure to monitor airspeed in relation to the rising position of the low-speed cue, (2) the flight crewÂ’s failure to adhere to sterile cockpit procedures, (3) the captainÂ’s failure to effectively manage the flight, and (4) Colgan AirÂ’s inadequate procedures for airspeed selection and management during approaches in icing conditions.""

At about 09:34, while the aircraft was climbing, an abnormal noise emanated from the No. 1 engine and instrument indications showed the occurrence of engine failure. The engine was then shut down and the aircraft requested emergency landing clearance from the Kagoshima Radar Approach Control Facility. The aircraft landed at Kagoshima Airport at 10:26.

PROBABLE CAUSE:
It is highly probable that this serious incident occurred through the following series of events:
While the Aircraft was climbing after takeoff, the RGB helical input gearshaft of the No. 1 engine sustained fatigue fracture and was detached from its position; the fragments of the broken shaft then flew off, damaging the engine case and breaking the blades of the HPT and the blades and vanes of the LPT and PT at the downstream stages, and this resulted in breakdown of the engine.
With regard to the fatigue fracture of the RGB helical input gearshaft, it is considered probable that fatigue cracks had started from the impurity inclusion present in the metal stock of the helical gear developed in the shaft, and after undergoing repetitive application of stress, the shaft was finally fractured.

Two safety recommendations were made on quality control and risk assessment.

During touchdown on runway 07 at 22:14, the aft fuselage touched the runway. After landing, the aircraft taxied to the gate as normal where the passengers were deplaned. There were no injuries and there was some damage to the aircraft.

Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors
1. The crewmembers were likely focused on having the pilot flying (PF) achieve a successful flare, to the exclusion of monitoring other approach parameters.
2. The captain provided vague instructions on managing power during the approach and the resultant settings went unchecked, resulting in an undesirable descent rate close to the ground.
3. The engine power was not adjusted sufficiently to arrest the descent rate and the aircraft was pitched to the contact angle in the flare, resulting in the aft fuselage striking the runway.

The flight crew became distracted with this failure and were unaware that the altitude select mode of the flight director had become disengaged and that the aircraft had descended below its cleared altitude. Descent continued until, alerted by an EPGWS warning, the pilots climbed the aircraft and re-established the glidepath. The investigation found that the IOP 1 failure was caused by intermittent electrical contact arising from cracked solder on two pins of a transformer on the IOP power supply module. It was further determined that there was a lack of appropriate operational guidance available to flight crews to deal with such avionics failures.

The crew calculated that the runway at Southampton Airport was not long enough for a flap 0Â° approach in icing conditions and decided to carry out an ILS approach to Runway 08 at Bournemouth Airport. The weather conditions reported at Bournemouth Airport were wind from 050Â° at 10 kt, 10 km visibility, broken cloud at 1,500 ft aal, and a temperature of 1Â°C.
Seven miles from touchdown on the final approach to Bournemouth Airport, the aircraftâ€™s landing gear was down, its speed was stabilised at a Vref of 150 kt IAS and its attitude was 5Â° nose-up. At 1,000 ft aal, the commander disconnected the autopilot and began to fly manually, in accordance with the Emergency Check List (ECL). When the aircraft was within approximately 2 nm of the runway, the co-pilot began to call out the aircraftâ€™s pitch attitude. As the aircraft approached the
touchdown point, the commander perceived a high rate of descent and increased the pitch attitude to reduce it.
The co-pilot called â€œPITCH 8Â°, DONâ€™T PITCH ANY MOREâ€ but, as the aircraft touched down, a Master Warning was triggered and the crew observed the TOUCHED RUNWAY caption illuminate on the CWP. The aircraft vacated the runway and taxied to a parking stand, where the pilots carried out a normal shutdown. An inspection of the aft lower fuselage of the aircraft revealed that the frangible touch runway detection switch was broken.

After closing the passenger door prior to departure from Riga International Airport (RIX), the warning light â€œFUSELAGE DOORSâ€ on the Caution and Warning Panel came on. Opening and closing passenger doors several times had no effect. The crew called technicians. MEL Item was open and after checking there was established that dispatch permitted according to MEL 52-10-5. The aircraft was released to service, Cabin Pressure Contol System INOP in â€œAUTO MODEâ€ with time limit 1 (one) flight day. It was the first line training flight for the F/O. Pilot Flying was F/O. During climb â€œFUSELAGE DOORSâ€ warning light disappeared and until FL 240 flight was normal in manual pressurization mode. After reaching FL 240 the PIC tried to stabilize cabin pressure and it was difficulty to set cabin rate at â€œ0â€. Because no more â€œFUSELAGE DOORSâ€ warning light switched on, PIC decided to set Cabin Pressure Contol System back to Auto Mode. After that cabin started climbing and a rapid depressuarization occurred, then PIC switched Manual Mode again, but it was impossible to control Cabin pressure and shortly the cabin altitude reached 10000 Ft. The crew declared emergency, started emergency descent procedure, returned back and landed in Riga International airport (EVRA).

Proximate Cause
The source or origin of an event that caused this incident was the fact that the Pilot in Comand due to lack of experience of aircraft type (200 flying hours on aircraft DHC8-Q400) as well as competency of Cabin Pressure Control System algorithms set on system in MANUAL MODE.
Root Cause
The factors that resulted this incident are location of aircraft passenger doors proximity sensors, which is open for unfavourable environment - atmospheric precipitation, ice and snow contamination of sensors during weather conditions with low temperatures.
Contributing causes
Documentation of Bombardier Inc. DHC-8 Series 400 Rev 4 Jan 24/2008 did not consist strict rules or warning about consequences if Cabin Pressure Control System is set on in Auto Mode during flight.
Preliminary rev 002 in airBaltic OM Part B, about inadmissible to set Cabin Pressure Control System in Auto Mode and consequences of such operation, was made when serious incident occurred, despite first problems with DHC-8 Series 400 presurization system occurred and repeated since August 2010.
Insufficient experience of flight and technical services with maintaining new type aircraft.
Primary cause
The event after which incident became inevitable.
Not possibility to control cabin pressure (increasing of cabin altitude) regardless that system was switched back from auto to manual mode, because the algorithms of Cabin Pressure Control System are such that it would take some time till system stabilizes.

The aircraft then circled before making an emergency landing back at Exeter. According to the official AAIB summary into the incident:

""After takeoff from Exeter Airport, as the landing gear was retracted, the inboard wheel of the right main landing gear separated from its axle and fell to the ground within the airport boundary. The crew entered a holding pattern to the east of the airport and carried out the â€˜Alternate Landing Gear Extensionâ€™ procedure. The aircraft returned to Exeter where it landed safely. The investigation found that the wheelâ€™s outer bearing had seized, most likely as a result of the bearing cage and cup having come into contact due to excessive movement of the cage, probably due to wear. This caused the bearing to fail catastrophically. Consequential damage had allowed the wheel to detach. Safety actions have been taken with the intention of preventing a recurrence.""

Nature of Damage: Right main landing gear inboard wheel detached

The loss of rotor thrust support caused the rotor to displace aft and contact adjacent stationary structures, including structures in the No. 2 bearing area. The resulting machining-type contact damage generated metal debris that contaminated the engine oil. Metal particles in the oil scavenged from the No. 2/2.5 bearing oil cavity damaged the engine oil pump and arrested its rotation, which caused torsional separation of the oil pump driveshaft, cutting off oil supply to the engine. The left engine oil pressure master warning activated. The flight crew did not shut down the engine. The engine operated 84 secondsÂ without oilÂ flow,Â until combustor and turbine component fire damage disrupted combustor flame stability and the engineÂ flamed out. The continued operation without oil flow elevated engine operating temperatures,Â and theÂ No. 5 engine bearing cavity temperature increased beyond the material properties of the No. 5 bearing seal runner. The seal runnerÂ expanded radially andÂ caused a hard rub against theÂ (titanium-alloy) No. 5 bearing flexible support. TheÂ local temperature at theÂ  contact pointÂ  rapidlyÂ reach its ignition temperature. The resulting titanium fire consumed the No. 5 bearing flexible support and progressed to adjacent thin-walled titanium components, including the diffuser diaphragm.Â Molten titanium droplets falling onto diffuser exit ducts located directly beneath the No. 5 bearing area melted through three of the exit ducts and penetrated the gas generator case.Â  The titanium fire self-extinguishedÂ when the conditions required for sustained titanium combustion were altered by the flameout and the case burn-through. The lack of circumferential titanium droplet distribution, the undamaged condition of the diffuser ring bore internal surfaces, and the gravity-driven nature of the case penetration indicate that the titanium fire originated external to the diffuser/engine gas path. The cockpit engine fire warning remained active when no fire was present because one of the nacelle fire/overheat detector elements was unable to reset due to a permanently deformed switch diaphragm.

Probable Cause: the flight crew's delay in shutting down the left engine following an engine oil pressure master warning, which led to a hard rub inside the engine that served as an ignition point for a titanium fire. Contributing to the event was a PW150 No. 5 seal design vulnerability to titanium ignition that can occur with continued engine operation following an engine oil pressure loss event.

One flight attendant received a serious injury and the airplane was not damaged. The flight was operating under 14 CFR Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Newark International Airport (KEWR), Newark, New Jersey to KDCA.

According to the operator, the flight crew had not received any PIREPS or NOTAMS of forecasted turbulence and the flight attendants (FAs) had just stowed the galley service carts when the turbulence was encountered. One FA was thrown to the floor injuring her foot. The flight attendant was assisted to a passenger seat where ice was administered to her swollen foot.

Paramedics met the flight upon landing and transported the injured flight attendant to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fracture in her right foot.

Probable Cause: an inadvertent encounter with clear air turbulence.

The crew assumed the warning was valid and carried out checklist actions designed to tackle fire or smoke from an unknown source. This resulted in power being removed from the co-pilotâ€™s flight displays, the autopilot, the Instrument Landing System (ILS), the transponder, the CVR and FDR, and caused the aircraft to begin to depressurise. The aircraft landed safely at Edinburgh following a Surveillance Radar Approach (SRA), vacated the runway and the passengers were evacuated onto a taxiway.
The investigation indicated that the spurious warning was probably caused by an intermittent short-circuit in a smoke detector connector as a result of moisture ingress.

The aircraft crew was then instructed by the ground controller to taxi on taxiway Echo and hold short of runway 28; SKV7516 read the instructions back correctly. As SKV7516 entered Taxiway Echo, the airport controller cleared a Beech A100 King Air (registration C-GJLJ) operating as Propair Incorporated flight PRO104 to take off from runway 28. Approximately 2 minutes later, SKV7516 reached the hold line of runway 28, and entered runway 28 without stopping. PRO104, which was approaching rotation speed, aborted take-off as soon as it saw SKV7516 on the runway. PRO104 veered to the right of the runway centreline and passed about 40 feet behind SKV7516.

Findings as to causes and contributing factors:
1. While the ground controller was instructing SKV7516 to hold short of Runway 28, the pilotsâ€™ attention was focused on an aircraft taxiing in the opposite direction. As a result, the SKV7516 pilots did not confirm between themselves the ground controllerâ€™s instruction to hold short of Runway 28, and resumed taxiing.
2. The SKV7516 flight crew members incorrectly believed that they were permitted to cross Runway 28 notwithstanding the first officerâ€™s accurate readback of the instruction to hold short of Runway 28. As a result, SKV7516 did not stop at the hold line and entered the runway.
3. The visual scan conducted by the SKV7516 captain was ineffective and did not identify that PRO104 was on Runway 28.
4. SKV7516 crossed Runway 28 without permission in front of PRO104, which was approaching its take-off rotation speed. Consequently, the runway incursion resulted in an extremely serious risk of collision.

Findings as to risk:
1. If an aircraft inspection is not conducted following a high-speed rejected take-off, there is a risk that a flight crew may take off with a damaged aircraft.
2. If a flight crew is tuned to an incorrect frequency as that crewâ€™s aircraft crosses a runway, there is an increased risk that the ground controllers and airport controllers will not be able to contact the flight crew.
3. In the absence of additional strategies to safeguard against runway incursions, the risk of collisions on runways will persist.

from Stand 9, to face north and to hold south of Bravo One Taxiway (approximately abeam Stand 7). This was a non-standard pushback to allow a Jetstream 41 on Stand 11 to taxi out via Bravo One, to Runway 02.
This was completed without incident, the tug was then disconnected and all personnel and equipment cleared from the area. One minute later the Jetstream 41, having already started its engines on stand, requested and
received permission to power back from Stand 111. At the end of the manoeuvre it stopped on Taxiway Alpha abeam Stand 10 and Stand 11. When DHC-8-402Q G-JEDO requested permission to push back and start from Stand 6; ATC
instructed it to â€œSTANDBYâ€. The Jetstream 41 was then given permission to taxi via Holding Point Bravo One, back track, line up and takeoff from Runway 02.

G-JEDO was given permission for a standard pushback and start from Stand 62. In attendance were a headset operative and a wingman positioned to the south of the aircraft, and the tug driver. Prior to commencing the pushback the headset operative indicated the direction of the pushback to the tug driver using hand signals. Two minutes later, having seen that the tug was disconnected from G-ECOO,
ATC asked the pilots if they were ready to taxi; they replied they would be in about 30 seconds. ATC replied, â€œTAXI PLEASE WHEN READY [HOLDING POINT] BRAVO ONEâ€. The wingman had by then left Stand 6 for another task. As G-JEDOâ€™s pushback neared completion it slowed and then stopped on a heading of approximately 220Âº. The headset operative asked the commander to confirm that the aircraftâ€™s brakes were OFF, which they were, then reported that they could not push the aircraft any further and asked for the aircraftâ€™s brakes to be set ON. A passing Airside
Operations vehicle reported to ATC that there was an â€œAIRCRAFT TO AIRCRAFT CONFLICT ON STAND 6.â€
G-ECOO then transmitted to ATC â€œWE JUST FELT A BUMPâ€ and asked for confirmation that they had been hit. After photographic evidence had been acquired, both aircraft were pulled back onto stand.
G-JEDO sustained damage to its right elevator, G-ECOO sustained damage to its tail cone

During the flight, the crew heard a ""thump"" and noted that the previously observed caution lights had extinguished indicating that the nose gear was retracted and the nose gear doors were closed. In accordance with abnormal procedures checklists, and guidance from the company, the crew elected to use the Alternate Landing Gear Extension checklist to prepare for landing at the destination

After pulling the main gear release handle and the nose gear release handle the crew observed that the main landing gear indicated down and locked with green indicator lights, the nose landing gear did not indicate down and locked, and the red Nose Gear Unsafe light was illuminated. The crew landed the airplane with the main landing gear down and the nose landing gear retracted, and the airplane came to rest on the main gear and forward fuselage on the runway.

Post-accident, the nose gear was successfully extended multiple times using the alternate extension handle and the landing gear was also extended multiple times under hydraulic power with no anomalies noted. Testing of landing gear system components did not reveal any failures that should have prevented the gear from extending via the alternate extension method. The pull force required to extend the nose gear alternate release handle to a position where the nose gear released from the up and locked position was measured at approximately 72 lbs.

According to manufacturer's design requirements, the pull length on the alternate release handle should be approximately 11 inches with a force of 90 pounds.

A post-accident review of the alternate gear extension procedures was conducted in a full flight simulator by the investigation group with the participation of the accident flight crew. The pull force required and the pull length required to extend the nose gear using the alternate extension handle was determined to be significantly lower in the flight simulator as compared to the aircraft. There was no guidance contained in the alternate landing gear extension procedure specifying required pull forces when using the alternate extension handle. Subsequent to the accident, the manufacturer added details to the alternate landing gear extension procedure in the Airplane Flight Manual regarding the maximum pull forces that a pilot may experience when the alternate extension handle is pulled.
Probable Cause: the nose landing gear alternate release handle was not pulled with sufficient enough force or distance to release the uplocks and allow extension of the nose landing gear.

Contributing to the accident was the dissimilar pull force and pull length set on the flight simulator that was used for flight crew training of alternate landing gear extension procedures and the lack of information available to crew members advising of the dissimilar pull force.

There were no injuries to the 31 passengers and 4 crewmembers onboard and the airplane received substantial damage. The flight originated from Little Rock Airport (LIT), Arkansas.
The first officer was the pilot flying and the captain was the pilot monitoring for the flight. During climb out after departure from LIT the first officer and the captain noticed a different airflow noise than normal when the landing gear was selected up. They observed an amber nose gear door open advisory light, a master caution, and a landing gear inoperative caution light. The three green gear indication lights and three red gear indication lights were extinguished indicating the landing gear was retracted. The captain performed the Nose Gear Door Malfunctions check list contained in the Quick Reference Handbook and the crew maintained airspeed of at or below 185 knots for the remainder of the flight as stated in the checklist.
During the flight to IAH, the crew heard a ""thump"" and observed the nose gear door amber status light and the LDG GEAR INOP caution light had extinguished.
In accordance with the Nose Gear Door Malfunctions check list, and guidance received from company maintenance and system operations control via ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System), the crew elected to use the Alternate Landing Gear Extension checklist for landing at IAH.
The crew exchanged roles as the captain became the pilot flying and the first officer assumed the role of pilot monitoring for the remainder of the flight.
Approximately over the ROKIT intersection, about 50 miles from IAH, the first officer began to perform the Alternate Landing Gear Extension checklist.
At 10:33:34 the first officer pulled the main gear release handle and the nose gear release handle and observed that the main landing gear indicated down and locked with green indicator lights, the nose landing gear did not indicate down and locked, and the red Nose Gear Unsafe light was illuminated. The alternate gear indication lights in the floor near the nose gear release handle agreed with the primary gear indication lights on the flight deck panel.
After the Alternate Gear Extension Procedure was completed, the crew could hear the nose gear door was ""flapping loosely"". The flight crew conducted a low approach and air traffic control tower personnel advised them that the nose gear doors appeared to be open but the nose gear did not appear to be down.
At 10:56:52 the captain briefed the cabin crew members and advised them that an evacuation, if necessary, would be conducted using the forward doors. The flight crew configured the airplane for landing at flaps 35 on runway 9 with the main landing gear down, and the nose landing gear retracted.
At 11:07:46, after passing through about 1,000 feet on approach, the first officer made a ""brace"" call over the passenger address system. The main gear touched down at 11:08:50 and the captain held the nose off the runway until the airplane slowed to about 80 knots. Once the nose touched down, there were sparks and smoke resulting from the fuselage scraping the runway and the airplane came to a stop at about 11:09. The captain ordered an evacuation and the pilots performed the On Ground Emergencies checklist. The passengers and crew evacuated through the forward cabin doors and were bussed to the terminal.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The nose landing gear alternate release handle was not pulled with sufficient enough force or distance to release the uplocks and allow extension of the nose landing gear.
Contributing to the accident was the dissimilar pull force and pull length set on the flight simulator that was used for flight crew training of alternate landing gear extension procedures and the lack of information available to crew members advising of the dissimilar pull force."""

Mineta International Airport (SJC/KSJC),"Boise Airport, ID (BOI/KBOI)","The flight was climbing through flight level 200 when the flight crew received a No. 2 engine audible fire warning, which was accompanied by a bang sound. The crew subsequently shut the No. 2 engine down and discharged both of the engine's fire extinguishing bottles. The cabin crew reported no visible fire, but the flight crew continued to receive a fire indication. The captain then declared an emergency, began a descent to the departure airport, and landed about 9 minutes after the event. After the airplane was stopped on the runway and the No. 1 (left) engine was shut down, an emergency evacuation was conducted using the main cabin door. An initial assessment by company personnel indicated that the fire damage to the airplane was limited to what was visible on the aircraft's exterior.

A visual postincident examination of the engine revealed that sooting was present on external case surfaces, which were concentrated on the aft half of the No. 2 engine. A disassembly of the engine confirmed that about half of the SED outer dome within the combustion section had separated and was subsequently ingested into the gas path. To determine the reason for the separation, three locations on the outer dome were sectioned and examined. All three locations exhibited insufficient weld penetration so that the welds remained totally contained within the SED outer dome and did not penetrate through to the inner duct as required by the manufacturing specifications.

Probable Cause: The failure and separation of a section of the No. 2 engine's combustion chamber's small exit duct (SED), which created an airflow disruption that led to an engine surge and subsequent fire. Contributing to the accident was the insufficient weld penetration that remained totally contained within the SED outer dome and did not penetrate through to the inner duct as required by the manufacturing specifications.

Marie Airport, ON (YAM/CYAM)","A Bombardier DHC-8-402Q Dash 8 aircraft, C-GLQO, sustained substantial damage in tailstrike accident on landing at Sault Ste. Marie Airport, ON (YAM), Canada. There were no reported injuries.
Porter Airlines flight 689 was on a visual short final approach to Sault Ste. Marie's Airport runway 30 when power was reduced to correct the descent profile. The aircraft's descent rate quickly increased and was not arrested with power application. The airspeed decreased, causing the approach to become unstabilized.
The aircraft landed hard and during the landing flair the pitch angle increased such that the tail of the aircraft contacted the runway surface. There was significant damage to the aircraft skin and structure where it contacted the ground. The aircraft taxied to the gate without further incident.

Findings as to causes and contributing factors:
1. Neither crew member identified that the airspeed had dropped below landing reference speed; the flight no longer met the requirements of a stabilized approach, and an overshoot was required.
2. The pilot monitoring did not identify the decreasing airspeed and increasing descent rate in time to notify the pilot flying or intervene.
3. In response to the pilot monitoring's warning to add power, the pilot flying pitched the nose up beyond the limits stated in the standard operating procedures and the manufacturer's pitch awareness training.
4. The high rate of descent coupled with the high nose-up attitude of the aircraft resulted in the hard landing that compressed the struts and allowed the tail to strike the runway.

Findings as to risk
1. If standard operating procedures do not clearly define the requirements for a stabilized visual approach, there is an increased risk that continued flight could result in a landing accident.
2. If standard operating procedures do not clearly define the duties of the pilot monitoring, there is an increased risk that unsafe flight conditions could develop.

No one was injured in the incdent.


Probable cause of the Serious Incident:
The probable cause of the incident is owing to improper handling of the flight & thrust controls by the First Officer while carrying out an unauthorized supervised landing on a Category C airport. The early reduction of power, high pitch attitude just prior to aircraft touchdown resulted into lower aircraft speed and tail strike.
Contributing factors to the incident are:
1. Pilot’s failure to scan/monitor the flight instruments and take appropriate & early action to control the aircraft pitch attitude prior to touchdown on runway.
2. Failure of the PIC to take over control from the Co-Pilot at an appropriate stage to correct the decaying speed while landing on the runway.
3. Non-adherence to SOP.

None of the 64 occupants were injured.
Croatia Airlines flight OU464 departed Zagreb-Pleso Airport (ZAG) at 17:46 on a regular flight to ZÃ¼rich. The flight was uneventful until the approach to ZÃ¼rich. The flight had been cleared for an ILS approach for a landing on runway 14.
At about six nautical miles from the threshold, the first officer lowered the landing gear lever to the DOWN position. Subsequently, the flight crew heard a loud and repetitive sound, which was described as being ""like a rubber hitting a metal"". The flight crew was under the impression that two components were hitting each other in the nose landing gear bay.
The flight crew then checked the landing gear indication lights on the instrument panel. Both main landing gear indication lights were green, indicating a down and locked position. The nose landing gear indication showed a discrepancy between the landing gear control lever and the landing gear position.
At this point, the flight crew decided to discontinue the approach and informed air traffic control accordingly. Immediately, Croatia 464 was ordered by ATC to climb straight ahead to 4000 feet QNH. A holding pattern for troubleshooting was offered by ATC and accepted by the flight crew. At 19:39 flight 464 entered the holding pattern at FL90.
Since the alternate landing gear extension procedure was not successful, the flight crew then went on with consulting the airplane manufacturer's flight operations service letter (FOSL) concerning issues with the landing gear. The problem persisted.
The flight crew finally decided to perform the landing at ZÃ¼rich Airport with the nose gear in the retracted position.
At 20:18, the airplane touched down on runway 14 with its main landing gear. As the airplane was decelerating, the nose was lowered and the airplane came to a complete stop 540 meters after the forward lower fuselage had come into contact with the runway surface.

During the technical investigation of the airplane by the Swiss Accident Investigation Board, the nose gear weight on wheel (WOW) cover plate was found squeezed between the lower and the upper drag strut of the nose landing gear. The WOW cover plate had previously fractured at the lower left and right lug enabling the pivoting of the plate upwards.

Causes:
The accident is attributable to the fact that the flight crew was not successful in extending the nose landing gear and then had to conduct a landing with extended main landing gear and retracted nose landing gear.
The following factor was identified as the direct cause of the accident:
- The WOW [weight on wheels] cover plate on the nose landing gear was broken on both lower lugs so that it was bent upwards around the upper tab mounts and was trapped in the nose gear mechanism, which prevented the extension.

The crack on the lower WOW cover plate lug is attributed to the following factors:
- The way the WOW cover plate was mounted led to lateral forces on the WOW cover plate and mechanical stress in the area of the upper and lower lugs during operation of the nose landing gear steering.
- There were weld defects in the area of the lower lugs.

As the airplane was leveling out, it encountered the first of a series of turbulent jolts of severe turbulence. The aft flight attendant had finished making a public announcement and was buckling herself into a jumpseat when the first jolt of severe turbulence hit. She was knocked out of the jumpseat onto the floor. The airplane encountered a second jolt of severe turbulence before she was able to get into her seat, and she was thrown to the ceiling and then back down to the floor, which resulted in a serious injury. The forward flight attendant had been checking on a passenger when the turbulence occurred and was thrown to the ceiling and hit the overhead bin. The passenger she was checking on flew out of his seat because he had not fastened his seatbelt, and he landed on the armrest of another seat.

Probable Cause: The airplane's encounter with known moderate-to-severe turbulence, which resulted in a serious injury to a flight attendant.

He went to lavatory. On the way to the lavatory he fell on the floor and fainted. Cabin crew No.1 was at the front station at that time and provided immediate assistance to the Captain.
Upon considering the Captainâ€™s condition the FO made the decision to turn back to Riga Airport. He declared emergency, and requested medical assistance as well as short radar vectors.
The descent, approach and landing were uneventful. The aircraft landed on runway 36 at 21:23 hrs. After landing the aircraft remained on the runway for ambulance and passenger disembarkation and was then towed and parked on stand at Riga Airport.
The Captain was remained under hospital care for 4 days where a gradual improvement in his condition was made.

Main Cause
""It is estimated that this serious incident was caused, when the aircraft was cruising the Commander (PIC) in duty of pilot flying became incapable of performing his duty normally by a loss of consciousness, which followed after sudden stomach upset as result of Acute Respiratory Viral Infection, Acute Gastroenterocolitis, Decompensated Diabetes and Hyperglycemia.
Concerning that the appearance of these symptoms was not predicted, it is estimated to contribute the PIC did not have any subjective symptoms before flight or under current aviation medical examinations is difficult if no subjective or objective symptoms are observed.""

The flight crew comprised a training captain, operating as the pilot monitoring (PM), and a trainee first officer (FO), operating as the pilot flying (PF). The flight crew had signed on at their home base, Brisbane, at 1045 Eastern Standard Time and were rostered to operate two Brisbane to Roma and return flights. The FO conducted the landing at Roma without incident using 35Â° of landing flaps (Flap 35). The aircraft departed Roma for Brisbane at 1323 and a visual approach to runway 19 at Brisbane Airport was commenced at about 1420. The weather for the approach included a crosswind of 18 kt and the possibility of light windshear at about 200 feet above the ground. Fifteen degrees of landing flaps (Flap 15) and a propeller RPM of 1020 were selected and the target approach speed was increased due to the prevailing wind conditions. The captain reported that despite the strong crosswind, the approach to land was well handled. Both the captain and the FO recalled that the initial flare led to a smooth/light touchdown and that the aircraft immediately became airborne again. The aircraft subsequently flew level at about 10 feet before settling onto the runway about 4 seconds later. Engine power, which had been set to flight idle as the aircraft descended through about 10 feet during the initial flare, remained at flight idle through to the second touchdown. That touchdown included a bounce, during which the main landing gear was briefly unloaded. The pitch attitude during this period reached 7.5Â° nose-up and the aircraft landed at 1425. After the second touchdown, which the crew described as a normal Flap 15 landing, the TOUCHED RUNWAY warning light illuminated. Believing the warning to be spurious, the crew contacted air traffic control who, after conducting a runway inspection, advised there was debris on the runway consistent with a tail strike.

There were no injuries.
During the weather briefing prior to departure, the captain and the first officer noted that there was a wintry pressure pattern, a trough accompanied by cold air would pass through western Japan during the morning, there was no specific information indicating the possibility of lightning on the flight planned route of the aircraft.
The DHC-8-400Q turboprop aircraft departed Fukuoka Airport, Japan at 09:03 hours local time on a flight to Fukue Airport. The captain was Pilot Flying.
While the aircraft was cruising at an altitude of 12,000 ft, heading for Fukue Airport, the captain and the first officer visually observed white clouds with a top height of 11,000 ft, on its course. When the aircraft began to descend at around 09:24 in order to approach the airport, the observed clouds were not so thick as could be suspected to cause turbulence or lightning but were displayed on the weather radar display of the aircraft in a green color, indicating an area with weak rainfall. At around 09:30, while descending through the clouds at 5300 ft, the captain and the first officer observed a strong flash of light coming from the left fore side of the cockpit and heard a loud ""bang"" immediately after that.
Afterwards, the captain and the first officer carried out checks to determine if there were any abnormalities. Although a wind noise was heard from the nose direction, no other abnormalities were identified.
On the final approach to the airport, the aircraft exited the clouds, and landed at the airport at 09:37.
After landing, the captain, the first officer and the mechanic carried out inspections on the aircraft, and consequently, the following were revealed:
- Five dents occurred on the aft side outer skin of the upper left access panel on the nose,
- Six rivet heads on the upper left access panel on the nose were burned, and
- The aft latch of the upper right access panel on the nose, as well as the fore and aft latches of the upper left access panel on the nose were opened.
The Company inspected the details of the damage of the aircraft, and confirmed that deformations had also occurred on the internal structure supporting the rear side outer skin of the upper left access panel on the nose.

PROBABLE CAUSES: ""In the accident, it is somewhat likely that the aircraft sustained damage on the aft side outer skin of the upper left access panel on the nose and on the portions of the internal structure supporting the outer skin because it was subjected to a powerful shockwave generated by the discharge of lightning while making a landing approach.""

The crew, comprising a training captain and a trainee FO, was rostered to operate a return scheduled passenger flight from Brisbane to Emerald, Queensland, followed by a return flight to Roma. The FO was the PF for the flight to Emerald and the captain was the PF for the return flight to Brisbane. The landing configuration used for those two landings was Flap 15 and a propeller RPM of 850. The flight to Roma departed Brisbane at 1655. Prior to descent into Roma, the crew conducted an approach and a threat and error management briefing that discussed the intention to use Flap 35 and a propeller RPM of 1,020 for landing. The briefing also included a reminder not to retard the power too quickly as the use of idle with 1,020 RPM would create more drag than at 850 RPM. The circuit and approach to land proceeded normally and the captain recalled that, as the aircraft passed through 50 feet, the FO had managed the approach well. At about 30 feet, and as the FO began to flare the aircraft to land, the captain observed the airspeed reducing and called for the FO to apply power. The airspeed reduce further and the aircraft contacted the runway firmly. The captain believed the engine torque at this time was about 20 per cent. The FO reported being aware of the need not to reduce the power too quickly and was surprised by the captainâ€™s call for additional power. By the time the FO comprehended the intent of the call for more power, the aircraft had contacted the runway. Engine power had been set to flight idle during the flare and touchdown occurred at 1802. The pitch attitude immediately prior to touchdown was
8.4Â° nose-up. Despite the firm landing, the captain believed it to be relatively normal and did not hear any unusual airframe noises. During the landing roll, the crew notice that the TOUCHED RUNWAY warning light was illuminated. The aircraft was taxied to the parking bay and after disembarkation, the crew visually confirmed that a tail strike had occurred.

It was night, and although there was no low cloud affecting the airport, the wind at Belfast was a strong west‑south-westerly, gusting up to 48 kt. Before the approach, the commander checked that his prosthetic lower left arm was securely attached to the yoke clamp which he used to fly the aircraft, with the latching device in place.
Although gusts over the crosswind limit for the aircraft were reported, the final wind report from ATC was within the limit, and the approach continued. The commander disconnected the autopilot and flew the aircraft manually. As he made the flare manoeuvre, with somewhat more than flight idle torque still applied, his prosthetic limb became detached from the yoke clamp, depriving him of control of the aircraft. He made a rapid assessment of the situation and considered alerting the co-pilot and instructing him to take control. However, because the co-pilot would have had little time to assimilate the information necessary to take over in the challenging conditions, the commander concluded that his best course of action was to move his right hand from the power levers onto the yoke to regain control. He did this, but with power still applied, and possibly a gust affecting the aircraft, a normal touchdown was followed by a bounce, from which the aircraft landed heavily.

Whilst climbing through FL160, a passenger informed the cabin crew that a cowling was missing at the left hand side of no. 2 engine. The cockpit crew then verified that the cowling at no 2 engine was missing, that most probably separated from the engine during the take-off roll or shortly thereafter. The cockpit crew continued with the flight to FABL, followed by an uneventful landing at Bloemfontein (FABL). It was observed that some damage was caused to the leading edge section, outboard of no 2 engine during the incident. No injuries were sustained.
The engine cowling was located approximately 660 metres from threshold of runway 01 at Cape Town International Airport (FACT) by the fire department (ARFF). The lower two latches of the cowling were found unlatched and the two side latches in the latched position.

The right hand engine left hand side cowling access cowling was not properly closed and latched when the engine oil uplifts were carried out during the night stop inspection. This work was being performed by an assistant who was not qualified to perform any work on the aircraft.
The Pre-flight inspection was also not properly conducted by the line maintenance and the flight deck crew prior to departure.

Probable Cause:
Right hand inboard engine cowling was not properly latched and locked during pre-flight inspection resulting in the separation from the aircraft during take-off.

During the landing, the aircraft touched down approximately 800 feet from the threshold of runway 26 but did not slow down in a timely manner. As the aircraft approached the end of the runway, the flight crew steered the aircraft toward the last taxiway to prevent an overrun. The aircraft came to a stop on the taxiway, shortly after exiting the runway. There were no injuries and no damage to the aircraft.

Findings as to causes and contributing factors:
During the landing roll, the flight crew did not adhere to the normal landing standard operating procedures (nosewheel de-rotation, position of power levers). In addition, only light braking was initially applied. As a result, the flight crew had difficulty slowing the aircraft in a timely manner and a runway overrun nearly occurred.

Findings as to risk:
If operators do not provide adequate simulator training for flight crews to recognize an unstable approach, then there is a risk that flight crews will continue an approach when it is unstable, which may lead to a landing incident.
If flight crews operate directional control systems outside the manufacturer's recommendations, then there is a risk that difficulties in directional control may occur.
If an air operator's safety management system does not include mandatory reporting of unstable approaches, then there is a risk that the practice will continue without being detected or monitored, which may increase the likelihood of an incident occurring.
If cockpit voice recordings are not available to an investigation, the identification and communication of safety deficiencies to advance transportation safety may be precluded.

After taking off from EPWA, the crew of the LOT3957 flight was climbing to the assigned FL90. Upon reaching the assigned FL, the crew of LOT3957 continued to ascend, which led to a breach of minimum separation and subsequently activated the airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS), generating ""RESOLUTION ADVISORY"" (RA) commands to perform maneuvers to avoid a collision. The lowest recorded separation values from the ACAS readout were 5 feet vertically and 1.8 NM horizontally (required 1000 feet and 3 NM).

During takeoff, as the DHC-8-402 aircraft approached rotation speed (Vr), there was a noticeable vibration that ended once the aircraft was airborne. Once the landing gear was retracted and the aircraft was established in the climb, the flight crew discussed the vibration. The cabin crew informed the pilots that a tire had blown.
Company maintenance and operations crews at its dispatch centre were contacted. Because of strong crosswinds, returning to Calgary was not an option, and a decision was made to land at Edmonton International Airport and to switch aircraft owing to the ruptured tire. Maintenance personnel recommended that a hard landing be avoided.
Air traffic control arranged for the aircraft to level at 13000 feet above sea level. The cabin crew confirmed that the number 3 tire had blown and revealed that something had struck the aft fuselage.
Throughout the approach phase of the landing sequence, the landing gear control panel indicated that the landing gear was down and locked. The aircraft touched down very lightly on runway 02 at Edmonton. As the wheels spun up, a pronounced vibration shook the aircraft 2.4 seconds after initial touchdown; while the nose wheel of the aircraft was still airborne, the right main landing gear collapsed. The right-side propeller blades struck the runway, and all were sheared on contact. One large section of a propeller blade penetrated the aircraft cabin next to passenger row 7. At the same time as the propeller contact, the nose landing gear came down hard and its tires ruptured. The aircraft slid slightly to the right and came to a stop off the right edge of the runway, approximately 3200 feet past the touchdown point.

Findings as to causes and contributing factors:
1. The number 3 tire ruptured on takeoff, most likely as a result of impact with a hard object.
2. During landing, the failed number 3 tire was spun by contact with the ground and was maintained at a rotational speed that was the same as or very close to one of the natural frequencies of the main landing gear. This caused the lock links to trigger the proximity sensor electronic unit to de-energize the solenoid sequence valve, thereby relieving system pressure from the extend port of the unlock actuator.
3. The excessive vibration caused the lock links to overcome the force from the downlock springs and unlock the stabilizer brace as a result of gear dynamics, which led to collapse of the right main landing gear.

The aircraft, an ATR-72, climbed to 4000 feet
with a rate of climb of 800 ft/min on true track 184 degrees. The crew then received a clearance to climb to FL190.
Meanwhile, Air Baltic flight BTI34H, a DHC-8-400, departed from the same runway on SID ERIVA 4E and began climbing to 4000 feet on true track 187 degrees. A further clearance was given to climb to FL170.
Initially after departure FCM72TX had high rate of climb but later the climb rate decreased. As a result the distance between both aircraft decreased and the Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA) signal triggered a warning about a potential conflict situation. The APP Controller, who was an instructor, tried to correct the potential conflict and stopped the climb of BTI34H at an altitude of 4000 feet. But due to late intervention and high rate of climb BTI34H stopped only at altitude 4400 feet. Notwithstanding that the SID's for traffic were on different directions, during the turn to the north the longitudinal separation betweeen FCM72TX and BTI34H decreased to less than 3NM and infringement of separation standards occurred. Horizontal distance between aircraft during the conflict was 2.7 NM, vertical 800 feet.


Causes
Proximate Cause:
The APP Controller-Student decision to clear succeeding aircraft BTI-34H to climb to FL170 without climb rate limit;

Root Cause:
The source or origin of an event that played the major role that caused this incident -infringement the separation minima between departing aircraft DH-8D and ATR-72-500 in the TMA was not strict complying the rules prescribed in the Approach Sector Operations Manual by the APP Controller-student, that lead to infringement of separation standards.

Contributing causes:
- Lack of Controller-student experience due to perform On-the-job training and starting initial phase of Practical Part, Sector Executive Position;
- Lack of procedures how to perform hand-over take over/take over of the position;
- Failure of the OJTI to communicate /coordinate Trainee actions in a timely manner;
- Late establishing first contact with APP controller after take-off to the contrary of requirements of the AIP Latvia.;

Primary cause:
The event after which incident became inevitable.
Decision of OJTI not to cancel wrong command by himself immediately upon recognizing studentsâ€™ mistake- wrong command.

Flight BE130 departed Glasgow at 18:18 hours, on a flight to Belfast City Airport. En route, at about FL 160 at approximately 18:32 hours, an emergency situation developed. The crew declared an emergency and diverted to Belfast International Airport, where it landed safely about 18:47 hours. After landing the no.1 engine was treated by fire fighters.

UPDATE: The official AAIB report into the incident was published on 9-6-2016. The summary of it reads as follows...

""The aircraft was en-route from Glasgow to Belfast, when an oil pressure failure and subsequent fire in the left engine prompted a diversion to Belfast Aldergrove Airport. The fire indications on the flight deck cleared several minutes after both fire bottles had been discharged into the engine nacelle. However, observations from the cabin suggested that the fire returned shortly before arrival at Belfast. The aircraft landed safely and stopped on the runway, following which the Airport RFFS confirmed there was still signs of fire. Consequently, the passengers and crew were evacuated from the aircraft, while the fire was rapidly extinguished.

The investigation revealed that the left engine oil pump assembly had failed. This was the result of fatigue cracking in an engine bearing key washer, which caused a section of the washer to be released and migrate to the engineâ€™s oil pump. Consequent mechanical failure of the oil pump assembly upset the oil flow, resulting in engine lubrication failure, internal overheat and fire.

In December 2015, the engine manufacturer issued an Alert Service Bulletin requiring specialist internal inspection of engines to be carried out, in a time span dictated by the service life of the relevant key washer. In addition to this on-wing inspection, a revision to the engine manual has been made requiring replacement of the key washer upon access, and a Service Bulletin has been issued requiring replacement on engine shop visits, for any reason. A new, improved key washer has also been introduced.""

Damage sustained to airframe: Per the AAIB report ""Damage to left engine and engine nacelle""

A Flybe spokeswoman stated to the BBC: ""when taxiing at low speed at the end of the runway, having landed safely at Inverness Airport this morning, the wheels of the Q400 aircraft skidded on the surface of the airfield, causing it to slide on to the grass.""

According to the following extract from the official AAIB report into the accident:

""The aircraft had landed on Runway 23 at Inverness following a flight from Manchester. ATC asked the crew to roll to the end of the runway and vacate at exit A1; thereafter they were to taxi to the South Apron. The commander reported that the aircraft slowed with minimal braking required but, as he commenced the right turn at exit A1, he lost control of the aircraft. It slid sideways to the left, coming to rest on the grass, pointing parallel to the taxiway centre line, but with all three landing gears partly sunk into the soft ground.

After requesting help from the rescue services, the crew shut down the engines and, after inspection of the landing gear by the Airport Fire Service, it was deemed safe to allow the passengers to disembark. An Airport Operations Assistant, who was preparing to marshal the aircraft onto its stand on the South Apron, watched the aircraft land. He stated that he would normally have turned away and returned to his marshalling position, but said that he continued to watch because he felt that the aircraft was travelling unusually fast as it reached the end of the runway.

He observed it turning right at A1 and heard the tyres squeal as it did so, raising the alarm when he realised it had gone onto the grass"".

10 Feb 1970,de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 100,N124PM,Pilgrim Airlines,5,"0,8 km off Waterford, CT",w/o,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/331220,DHC-6 Twin Otter,DHC6,18:37,41,Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-20,Fatalities: 5 / Occupants: 5,0,Accident,Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,"New London-Groton Airport, CT (GON/KGON)","New York-John F. Kennedy International Airport, NY (JFK/KJFK)","Pilgrim Flight 203 departed from Groton about 16:21, approximately 15 minutes behind schedule primarily because of ground delays encountered on previous flights which used the aircraft. Shortly after takeoff, Flight 203 reported on course and was instructed to contact the New York Center. Communications were established at 16:27 and the Center cleared the flight to Deer Park via its flight plan route to cross Saybrook at 4,000 feet, and then to climb and maintain 6,000 feet. At 16:33, the New York Center controller recleared the flight to Deer Park, to climb to 9,000 feet, and issued it holding instructions at Deer Park. About 2 minutes later, the controller advised that 7,000 feet was open for the flight, with the possibility of no holding, and he cleared it back to 7,000 feet. The flight reported at 7,000 immediately thereafter. About 16:36, the controller told Pilgrim 203 that if holding were necessary, its expected approach clearance time was 17.06. At 16:47 the crew contacted Kennedy Approach Control and they reported holding at Deer Park at 7,000 feet. About this time, the weather conditions at the Kennedy Airport deteriorated, and some flights which were then making instrument approaches to runway 13L began missing their approaches. Because of this, instrument approaches were changed to runway 22R, which had a better RVR. At 16:55, in connection with the runway change, Pilgrim 203 was recleared to hold in the Medford holding pattern. At 1709, Pilgrim 203 was given an expected approach clearance time of 17:46, which the flight acknowledged. At 17:39, the Kennedy approach controller cleared Pilgrim Flight 203 to descend to 6,000 feet. At 17:42, the crew of Pilgrim 203 radioed: ""Pilgrim 203 request New Haven if we can get there, expedite."" At 17:48, the flight was cleared to descend to 4,000 feet, and at 1750, it was cleared to Pond Point, which is the final approach fix from which VOR instrument approaches are made to New Haven-Tweed Airport. During the next minute, Pilgrim Flight 203 contacted Westchester Approach Control and asked for the latest Tweed weather. It was advised that the weather was: Scattered clouds
200 feet, estimated ceiling 500 feet broken, 700 feet overcast; visibility 2 miles, rain and fog; altimeter 29.46: wind variable 120deg to 040deg at 15 knots with gusts to 25 knots. At 17:53, the Westchester approach controller instructed Flight 203, ""Upon reaching Pond Point hold southwest on the 205 radial, right turns, EAC 1815."" Two minutes later the controller checked the position of the flight and, finding it was suitable for descent, cleared the flight to descend to 3,000 feet. At 17:57, the flight reported at Pond Point and asked if holding were still necessary. The controller advised that it was and repeated the holding instruction. At 18:12, the Westchester approach controller called Flight 203 and advised that, based on a report from the Cessna pilot who just landed, the airport was below minimums. He advised the weather was: Aircraft ceiling 200 feet broken, 500 feet, overcast: visibility 2 miles. He then asked the pilot his intentions. About 18:13, after asking for and being given the Bridgeport weather, which was lower than New Haven, the flight advised it would make the approach. The flight was cleared for the approach and instructed to contact New Haven Tower. This was done, and, at 1814, the flight advised New Haven it was inbound from Pond Point. The controller acknowledged, cleared the flight to land, and repeated the surface wind as variable 120deg to 060deg, 15 knots with gusts to 25 knots. Shortly before 18:17, Flight 203 reported to New Haven it had missed its approach. The tower controller immediately cleared the flight to the Madison VOR at 2,000 feet and instructed it to contact Westchester Approach Control. At 18:17, the flight asked for the Groton weather. The controller then gave the flight the Groton weather as: Measured ceiling 300 feet overcast; visibility 1-1/2 miles, moderate rain and fog; wind 100deg at 15 knots, with gusts to 25 knots; altimeter 29.50. At 18:19, the crew told the controller, ""Westchester, weÂ’d like to ah get direct Groton right now."" Within the same minute, the controller advised he was getting the clearance. The flight repeated that it had to get direct to Groton and the controller replied he had to coordinate (with New York Center). At 18:20, Flight 203 advised the Westchester controller, ""Ah Westchester, 203 ah we got minimum fuel now, we gotta get to Groton."" About 18:21, the controller cleared the flight to the Groton VOR via Victor Airway 126 and climb and maintain 3,000 feet. The flight reported it was level at 3,000 feet and asked to be cleared for an approach to Groton direct from Saybrook. The controller advised the flight to contact Quonset Approach Control. At 18:22, Flight 203 called Bradley FSS and advised it could not contact Quonset Approach Control, it was low on fuel, and wanted clearance for an instrument approach direct to Groton from Saybrook. On request, Quonset Approach Control gave this clearance to Bradley FSS and, at 18:23, the latter delivered it to the flight. About 18:24, the captain of Flight 203 called his company radio and said, ""WeÂ’re coming home with this... pile of junk. We ainÂ’t got any equipment working."" He then asked to talk to the chief pilot. The captain asked initially for the Groton weather which was ceiling 300 feet, overcast; visibility 1-1/2 miles, rain and fog Later, he was advised that the ceiling had lowered to 200 feet. The captain said that Kennedy would not accept him because the aircraft transponder was not working. He said he was inbound to Groton on the 270 degree radial of the Groton VOR, flying about 100 feet above the water, and he could see the shoreline. Asked how much fuel he had remaining, the captain answered ""none,"" and added, in essence, that fuel exhaustion could occur at anytime. Shortly thereafter, he radioed that he had lost one engine and was going to try to reach the shore. He then said he had just lost the other engine, could not make the shore, and was going into the water off Harkness Point. This was the last transmission from the aircraft.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Fuel exhaustion resulting from inadequate flight preparation and erroneous in-flight decisions by the pilot-in-command.""

Destination was Lae, with en route stops at Banz, Minj, Chimbu, Goroka and Kainantu. The service proceeded uneventfully via the first four intermediate stops and the aircraft departed Goroka for Kainantu at 08:52 hours with nine passengers, including four children, on board.
The flight plan for this sector indicated that the aircraft would take 15 minutes to fly the 25 miles from Goroka to Kainantu and the proposed cruising level was 7,500 feet above mean sea level or approximately 1,500 feet above the general level of the en-route terrain.
The aircraft was following the normal route from Goroka, but flying very low and just beneath the extremely low cloud that persisted in the area. Flying right at the base of the overcast, the aircraft then entered a saddle in a ridge that lay at right angles to its track. Almost immediately afterwards, the engine noise increased and the aircraft banked steeply into a turn to the left.
The turn continued through about 180 degrees until the aircraft, just clearing the slopes of the northern side of the saddle, was heading back in the direction from which it had come. But before it could regain the area of lower terrain to the west of the ridge, the aircraft flew into a stand of tall trees on top of a spur in the saddle. Cutting a swathe through the trees the aircraft cleared the top of the spur itself and crashed on to a grass covered slope on its western side.

CAUSE: The probable cause of the accident was that the pilot persisted with such determination or confidence in his attempts to reach his destination in the face of deteriorating weather conditions, that he did not ensure he could safely discontinue the approach at any time and still maintain visual reference to the significant terrain."

Weather at La Crosse was reported being indefinite ceiling, 500 feet obscuration, visibility half a mile, light drizzle and fog. Shortly after 4 pm the flight passed the Holman Intersection at 3000 feet msl, descending to the Midway final approach fix which was crossed at 2100 feet. The pilot leveled the plane at 1100 feet. Shortly thereafter, the plane struck trees. Both wings, the engines, the left main landing gear, strut an left horizontal stabilizer separated from the aircraft.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""For reasons unknown, the captain failed to maintain altitude at minimum descent altitude and allowed the aircraft to descend below the height of the trees while executing a nonprecision instrument approach in instrument flight conditions.""

The aircraft climbed to FL70 and initially flew above the cloud layer.
Before the aircraft started descent, it had been informed on the radio of the prevailing weather at Kuusamo Airport: surface wind 160Â°, 6 KT occasionally 10 KT, visibility 10 km, clouds 8/8 1000 feet, temperature -7Â°C, QNH 989 mb. After the aircraft had left its cruising level at approximately 07:24 GMT it entered icing conditions in clouds between 6000 and 5000 feet.
When approaching 3000 feet, the right engine of the aircraft suddenly lost its power. The crew immediately feathered the right-hand propeller, changed to single-engine flight and turned back in the direction of Oulu while informing Kuusamo Airport ATC about the incident.
Kuusamo ATC cleared the aircraft to FL 60 for the return flight to Oulu. The crew reported that the flight back to Oulu would last one hour and at the same time stated that the climbing performance of the aircraft did not permit a climb to the planned FL 60. The crew asked for FL 30 as its flight altitude and was cleared to that level by the ATC. After the engine failure the pilot-in-command had intended to climb to FL 60, where flight in clear air and without the danger of icing had been possible. Because of the icing of the aircraft, its climbing performance when flying on one engine had, however, not been sufficient for a climb to FL 60. The aircraft had been able to climb about 700 feet to reach an altitude of appr. 3700 feet but was incapable of increasing the altitude above that level. The aircraft had continued its flight in the direction of Oulu but began to continually lose altitude because of increased icing in spite of the engine power being used in the left engine exceeding the maximum continuous thrust values. The aircraft had at the end of the flight been given an estimation of the altitude of the prevailing cloudbase in the region, which was reported to be 300-500 feet. As the loss of height continued, the crew had hoped that they would get below the cloudbase and the ice formed on the aircraft would fall off or that they would be able to make a landing in the terrain choosing a suitable place for emergency landing. However, the weather in the region had been such that there was practically no clearance between the clouds and the terrain. The aircraft had lost so much height by the time it had arrived at the area of Naamanka village in Pudasjarvi parish that the first landmark the co-pilot had seen had been a trigonometric tower which the aircraft passed over by only a few metres. About three kilometres after the passing of the tower, while the pilot-in-command was trying to pick out a landing place and having difficulties to control the aircraft, it had at 08:04 GMT struck the trees and hit the ground in a swampy, sparsely wooded area 5 km north of Iinattijarvi.
As a result of the impact three persons were quite badly injured while the others received only minor injuries, contusions, and bruises, and the aircraft was destroyed beyond repair.

Cause of the accident:
The main reason for the aircraft accident has been the sudden breakdown of the turbine of the right engine so that the engine has lost its power and flight on one engine in icing conditions has become inevitable.
The icing on the wet surfaces of the aircraft which lacked de-icing and anti-icing equipment and the consequent deteorioration in the performance of the aircraft was decisively contributory to the accident.
The performance of the aircraft when flying on one engine has been insufficient after the icing had taken place considering the weight of the aircraft at the time of the accident."

At 16:04 the crew contacted LAX arrival and reported over Rose Hills. The flight was then cleared for the Terminal Control Area (TCA) and no. 2 arrival to runway 24L. At 16:05 the crew were advised that they had traffic 5,5nm in front of them climbing from 1500 to 3000 feet which was a police helicopter on a VFR flight. The arrival controller transmitted another advisory about the helicopter at 16:06, but there was no response. It appeared the Twin Otter had collided in flight at 2200 feet with a Cessna 150 aircraft (N11421). The Twin Otter was flying on a 250deg heading descending 300 feet/min at 146 knots airspeed while the Cessna was flying at 94 kts; the closing speed was 174 kts. The Cessna, operated by CessnAir Aviation had departed from Long Beach on a local training flight at 15:46. Both aircraft crashed. Debris caused some damage to houses and lawns near the crash site.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The failure of both flight crews to see the other aircraft in sufficient time to initiate evasive action. The Board is unable to determine why each crew failed to see an avoid the other aircraft; however, the Board believes that the ability of both crews to detect the other aircraft in time to avoid a collision was reduced because of the position of the sun, the closure angle of the aircraft, and the necessity for the Twin Otter's fight crew to acquire visual contact with radar-reported traffic directly in front of them.""

Examination of the fuel system revealed that the fuel supply for the right engine was not transferring automatically to the no.4 cell which feeds the engine, but was spreading out by gravity to the other cells. This would be aggravated in a descent, and it is likely that the right engine flamed out during the turn due to fuel starvation.
The flapper valves in no.4 and 5 tanks were not of the approved type and were not installed properly. The fuel injector nozzle in the fuel transfer system for the right engine was plugged due to the coarse mesh fuel strainers which allowed foreign particles to penetrate."

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's lack of altitude awareness during a circling approach permitting the aircraft's flight path to deviate below a safe approach profile. The aircraft's rate of descent and descent flight path angle increased as a result of windshear encountered during visual approach below minimum descent altitude. The flight crew did not recognize these flight path deviations because they were relying on visual references which were degraded by non-homogeneous fog and on kinesthetic cues which were adversely affected by the aircraft's forward centre of gravity resulting from the improperly loaded aircraft. Contributing to the accident was the lack of company procedures requiring altitude-callouts during the visual portion of an approach.""

He was suffering from a mild head cold which he considered was not sufficiently severe to prevent him from flying. He had not sought medical opinion and has stated that he had taken no medication.

After completion of pre-flight preparations the aircraft departed Sydney at 1830 hours. The flight to overhead Cootamundra was uneventful.

The pilot has reported that there was broken cloud in the vicinity of the town with tops at approximately 3000 feet, through which the reflected lights of the town could be seen. He descended visually over the town to 2100 feet above mean sea level, which is 1000 feet above aerodrome elevation. He entered the left downwind leg for runway 16, at which time the aircraft was seen by a witness awaiting its arrival at the aerodrome terminal.

During the course of the downwind leg the pilot carried out pre-landing checks, including the deployment of 10 flap. The runway lighting was already visible to him on his left, but ahead and to the right there were no ground lights and no discernable horizon, so that having passed abeam the runway threshold - at which point the left engine nacelle obscured all of the aerodrome lighting - he was dependent on the aircraft's flight instruments.

The pilot has stated that prior to turning on to base leg of the circuit, he confirmed that the altitude was 2100 feet, that the indicated airspeed was the required 97 knots and that the aircraft's attitude was correct. He reduced engine torque to allow for a gradual descent, intending to establish the aircraft at 1700 feet (that is 600 feet above threshold elevation) at the start of the final approach. In the vicinity of the turn onto base leg the pilot states he experienced pain in his ears and blew his nose to effect a cure, which resulted in a period of dizziness which he estimates lasted two or three seconds. He states that just prior to completing his turn to base leg he flew through a small patch of unseen low stratus for about two seconds and then, on sighting the runway, realised he was low. He immediately took action to increase altitude but at that instant felt a firm bump. He concluded that the aircraft had struck the ground and continued with the climb to overhead the aerodrome to assess damage to the aircraft.

Two witnesses, at the aerodrome terminal building, had their attention drawn to the aircraft by the surge of engine power. They saw it low down in the mid base leg position, climbing.

The pilot determined that the rudder and brake pedals were jammed, and the nose wheel steering tiller on the control column was slack and inoperative, thus he was deprived of all control of the rudder, nose wheel steering and wheel braking.

The ground impact had forced the nose landing gear upwards in its attach area, displacing some, and breaking other elevator and rudder control cable pulleys which caused slackening of the cables. This slackness resulted in a limitation of elevator control from the normal, but the pilot did not become aware of this. He advised Flight Service that he would divert to Wagga Wagga and requested that emergency services be made available.

The aircraft landed at Wagga Wagga at 2026 hours EST. Because of the absence of directional control, it veered off the runway on to an unobstructed grass area before coming to rest without further incident.

The damage to the aircraft was consistent with it having struck the ground in a slightly left banked attitude at a rate of descent of the order of 15-20 feet per second. Passenger evidence confirms that the impact occurred in the Cootamundra circuit area, but an extensive air and ground survey failed to locate any ground impact marks, and the precise impact point has not been located.

Flight WF710 took off from Trondheim (TRD), Norway, at 19:23 local time on a domestic light to Namsos (OSY), BrÃ¸nnÃ¸ysund (BNN), SandnessjÃ¸en (SSJ) and BodÃ¸ Airport (BOO).
The flight to Namsos was uneventful. The aircraft took off from Namsos at 20:07 and contacted Trondheim ACC six minutes later, stating that they were climbing from FL70 to FL90. At 20:20 the crew began their descent for BrÃ¸nnÃ¸ysund and switched frequencies to BrÃ¸nnÃ¸ysund AFIS.
Weather reported at BrÃ¸nnÃ¸ysund was: wind 220Â°/05 kts, visibility 9 km, 3/8 stratus at 600 feet and 6/8 at 1000 feet, temperature +6 C, QNH 1022 MB.
The crew executed a VOR/DME approach to BrÃ¸nnÃ¸ysund's runway 04, followed by a circle for landing on runway 22. The crew left the prescribed altitude 4 NM early. The aircraft descended until it flew into the Torghatten hillside at 560 feet.

A retired police officer reported in July 2013 that a passenger had taken a mobile phone on board. The police officer disembarked the plane at Namsos, a stop-over and reported that the passenger with the mobile phone was seated in the cockpits jump-seat.
After the accident, he reported this fact to the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC). After reading the investigation report during the 25th anniversary of the accident, he noticed that there was no mention of the mobile phone.
NMT 450 network-based mobiles at the time were fitted with a 15-watt transmitter and a powerful battery which could lead to disruption in electronic equipment.
The Norwegian AIB conducted an investigation to determine if electronic interference from the mobile phone might have affected the flight instruments. The AIB concluded that there was no evidence to support the theory that there was any kind of interference.

The cause of the accident was that the last part of the approach was started about 4 NM too soon. The aircraft therefore flew below the safe terrain clearance altitude and crashed into rising terrain. The Board cannot indicate any certain reason why the approach started so early.

The flight preparations were running according to schedule and there was no evidence of a need to rush the normal procedures. Following the starting of Nos 4 and 1 engines, the commander requested of the supervising ground engineer that the ground power supply should be removed. The ground engineer was in voice communication with the cockpit via a long intercom lead which allowed him to move freely round the nose of the aircraft.

The engineer signalled for the Ground Power Unit (GPU) to be disconnected and observed an operator of that unit walk away from the aircraft with the electrical cable in tow. He therefore, as is normal procedure, positioned himself on the left of the nose where he could be seen by the commander in case of intercom failure. From this position he was unable to see the aircraft's right main landing gear, but had reason to believe was free of obstruction. The tug driver, seated on the right side of his cab, was also unable to see the right main landing gear.

On the commander's request for push-back, the ground engineer asked him to release the brakes and signalled the tug driver to begin push-back. Almost immediately, the commander felt a bump, not an unusual occurrence at the start of a push-back, but the ground engineer suddenly ""became agitated"" and Signaled the tug to stop, whilst informing the commander that someone had been run over and that the aircraft was going to be pulled forward again. The commander therefore called ATC and requested the attendance of an ambulance

30 Jan 1991,de Havilland Canada DHC-7-110,G-BOAW,British Midland,0,near Brussels-Zaventem Airport (BRU/EBBR),non,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/521607,DHC-7 Dash 7,DHC7,c. 19:10 LT,110,,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 29,0,Incident,Initial climb,Passenger - Scheduled,Brussels-Zaventem Airport (BRU/EBBR),London-City Airport (LCY/EGLC),"The aircraft was engaged on a scheduled return passenger service between London City Airport and Brussels. After arriving at Brussels, where the ambient temperature was -1Â°C, it spent one hour on the ground, during which time some condensation formed on the outside surfaces but no ice was evident. It departed for the return flight at 1900 hrs.

Some 10 minutes after take-off, whilst climbing with the autopilot engaged and vertical speed mode selected to achieve a 600 feet per minute (fpm) climb, the aircraft pitched sharply nose-up and the Indicated Airspeed (IAS) dropped. The Universal Flight Data Recorder (UFDR) showed that as the aircraft was climbing at 600 fpm through 8,000 feet at approximately 175 kt, it pitched up from +3Â° to +11Â° and the speed decreased to 162 kt before a normal climb was resumed. This pitch disturbance
was preceded by the elevator trim moving steadily in a nose-up direction. The commander did not disengage the autopilot but instead pressed the Touch Control Steering (TCS) button and returned the aircraft to a normal climbing attitude. He considered various possible causes of the pitch-up including, autopilot altitude capture malfunction, an out of trim situation and the movement of passengers and/or hold baggage. He selected elevator de-icing and the cabin attendant was called to
check passenger positions and baggage loading. The commander also considered the possibility of wake turbulence but had no evidence of any other aircraft in the vicinity which might have caused it. He also rejected the possibility of airframe icing because the aircraft had not encountered any cloud during the climb out from Brussels.

He continued the climb to his flight plan cruising level of Flight Level (FL)140, where he leveled off and established a normal cruise configuration at 182 kt, clear of cloud and in smooth air. After the initial pitch-up, elevator trim operation appeared to be normal. During the cruise he intermittently engaged and disengaged the autopilot. The commander described a slight resistance in pitch control in manual flight and a tendency to instability in pitch in both autopilot and manual controlled flight. He stated that the elevator control felt 'notchy' and the control column tended to move away from the neutral, trimmed position. Consequently it required particular concentration to hold it in the neutral position. He felt, nevertheless, that he had adequate control of the elevators for continued safe flight.

After some 10 minutes in the cruise at FL140 the commander began an early descent in order to check the handling characteristics at lower altitude. He received clearance to descend to FL80, where he found that the aircraft tended to be slightly more divergent in pitch but was still controllable. He continued to Southend, descending to 5,000 feet where he encountered some stratus cloud, and began an orbit over Southend whilst he discussed the situation with ground maintenance engineers at his destination. On their advice he disconnected the left/right elevator controls and aircraft handling appeared to be the same on both control channels. The first officer commented that, with the controls split, control of the aircraft in pitch required larger control inputs than those he recalled from training exercises in that configuration. The commander then reconnected the split controls and instructed the first officer to pull the autopilot and yaw damper circuit breakers. This action also had no effect on the apparent abnormal handling characteristics. The commander commented that from that moment on he was distracted by the autopilot warning horn, which sounded continuously until the aircraft was landed and shut down.

He continued the flight to London City STOL Airport, descending to 3,000 feet in preparation for an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach. When the aircraft was slowed to 140 kt the elevator control still felt notchy, with the control column resisting attempts to hold it in the neutral trim position. At this stage the manual trim wheel appeared to stiffen up. The commander decided to make an early selection of landing gear and flap at 3,000 feet in order to assess any effect this might have on his margin of control. Both the commander and the first officer reported that the nose
pitched down sharply when flaps were selected to 15Âº, leading to the decision to retract them again quickly. The UFDR showed no evidence of this pitch-down and showed that the flaps ran to no more than 5Â° down before they were reselected up.

The commander then decided that it would be prudent to make a flap-less landing and advised Air Traffic Control (ATC) accordingly, declaring an emergency and requesting diversion to the conventional airport at Stansted. He instructed the cabin staff to brief the passengers to prepare for a precautionary landing and to demonstrate the brace position to be adopted if so instructed.

ATC provided radar headings for the aircraft to intercept the Stansted localizer. Shortly before touch-down the commander instructed the passengers to adopt the brace position as a precaution in case of loss of pitch control in the flare. He was, however, able to execute a safe flap-less landing on runway 05. He reported that the aircraft became harder to control during the ILS approach, which was flown for the most part using power rather than elevator to control pitch attitude. He also had the
impression that the manual trim wheel had become progressively stiffer during the latter part of the flight.

After the landing at Stansted, a group of maintenance personnel from London City Airport travelled to the aircraft where they removed the autopilot computer and controller, the pitch servo-drive and the pitch trim motor. Replacements were installed for the computer, the controller and the servo-drive, but the electrical connection to the servo-drive was left unconnected and the autopilot was isolated by locking out the three relevant autopilot and yaw damper circuit breakers. The trim motor was not replaced. Functional checks of the flying controls were carried out together with an examination of the pitch control circuit.

The aircraft was then flown back to London City Airport. When interviewed subsequently, the pilot who carried out the ferry flight reported that no problems were encountered and that the flight was conducted in a basically normal manner in terms of flap and landing gear operation and speed range used. Only the maximum height reached, and the flight duration, differed from those of a typical revenue flight.

At 3000 feet the autopilot mode selector lights changed from 'Altitude armed' to 'Altitude capture' but the aircraft failed to level-off. The autopilot was disengaged, the height lock was reset and the autopilot was re-engaged but it still failed to hold the required height. The aircraft was then cleared to FL 100 and a normal climb was resumed with the autopilot engaged once more. At FL100 the autopilot again failed to level the aircraft. It was then disengaged and the flight was continued in manual control.

The commander reported that in level cruise the elevator control felt slightly stiff, giving him the
impression that the autopilot clutches had not disengaged fully. When he began the descent into
London City Airport he found that the elevators still felt slightly stiff, the elevator trim was abnormally sensitive and its setting was more nose-down than normal. Nevertheless, despite these abnormalities, he considered that he still had adequate control of the elevators. During the approach to land at London City Airport landing gear and the initial stage of flap were selected without further adverse effects. As the aircraft descended below 1000 feet, elevator control became noticeably stiffer and, when full flap was selected, he found that the neutral trim position was fully forward. In the flare considerable back pressure was needed on the control column and, as this pressure was applied, he heard a slight snapping or clicking noise from the rear of the aircraft, after which elevator control pressure appeared to return to normal. The first officer reported that he saw the control column jolt backwards during the landing flare.

The readout from the flight recorder showed that, as the aircraft passed 2500 feet in the climb with the autopilot engaged, it pitched down from +5Â° to 0Â° and then pitched up to +12Â°, at which point the autopilot was disconnected. Some 50 seconds later, after the pitch attitude had been returned to
normal, presumably under manual control, the autopilot was re-engaged and appears to have controlled the aircraft normally during a climbing turn to the left through 140Â°. About 2 minutes later, whilst the aircraft was still under autopilot control, a small, regular fluctuation of elevator angle occurred, which was mirrored by similar small fluctuations in the elevator trim and normal g traces. A similar fluctuation of elevator and trim tab angle was seen to have occurred for some three minutes on the previous flight as the aircraft descended to land at Lille. This earlier fluctuation showed clearly on the normal g trace and ceased only when the autopilot was disconnected.

The aircraft was later flown from London to Plymouth with the autopilot disconnected. The pilot on
this flight reported that after take-off the elevators became very heavy and that control in pitch had to be assisted by trim and power. He also reported that, even though he had not selected full flap for
landing, a very heavy pull on the control column was needed to flare the aircraft, and this heavy
pressure produced enough flare only to achieve a very flat landing.

The aircraft was then re-possessed by DNK Leasing, registered in the Cayman Islands and ferried to Guernsey for extensive maintenance. The aircraft remained out of service at Guernsey airport for approximately one year whilst it underwent an extensive programme to ensure that all maintenance required during the previous two years had been fully implemented. This was found to be necessary because the extent of the work carried out during its period in Egypt was not clearly defined by the supporting documentation.
The initial test flight was flown on 25 November 1998, and was satisfactory except that the aircraft did not achieve the requisite climb performance. It was established that No 3 engine was not producing the rated power. This engine was changed and an abbreviated test flight was planned for the 28 November 1998; it was intended that this flight would only cover those elements related to aircraft performance.
Descending from FL100 , at around 7000 feet the no. 1 engine was shutdown. The other three operating engines were at a low power setting. The autopilot was engaged and the flaps were up. The aircraft was then leveled at 5000 feet. As the autopilot attempted to maintain level flight, the pitch attitude increased and the airspeed reduced at a rate of about 1Ã—5 kt. At about 95 KIAS, with the autopilot still engaged and the elevator and the pitch trim continuing to provide a positive pitch-up demand, the pitch attitude started to decrease. The maximum pitch attitude achieved was 8Â°. The onset of vibrations occurred at about 97 KIAS. Coincident with this was a slight forward movement of the elevator, prior to this the elevator and pitch trim were consistently moving nose up together. The autopilot was not disconnected until 6 seconds later.
The power was then increased on all three operating engines and the autopilot was disconnected. The elevator was 12Â° and the pitch trim 16.4Â°, both positive (pitch up) demands. The airspeed was 89 KIAS. The power continued to increase on the three operating engines and the aircraft began to roll to the left to a maximum of 80Â° angle of bank and this was opposed by the use of up to 54Â° right spoiler. The pitch attitude reduced to 54Â° nose down. Power was than reduced on the operating engines. The maximum rate of rotation about the yaw axis was 60Â°/sec. The DHC-7 spiraled down, crashed nose-down into a field and burst into a flames. The Dash 7 came down close to the A38 at Bickington near Ashburton.

The accident is said to have been caused by the crew's complacency and inexperience. They failed to detect that incorrect navigational information had been input to the aircraft's FMS resulting in the flight deviating from its planned course and entering a mountainous area. A factor would have been the crew's insufficient rest."

No injuries were sustained by the airline transport certificated pilot or second pilot, the flight attendant, or 15 passengers.
The flight was operated by Raytheon Systems Engineering for the United States Army and departed Kwajalein at 20:29 destined for Roi-Namur. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed. Approaching Roi-Namur, when the landing gear was lowered, the nose gear indicated unsafe and, without landing, the flight returned to Kwajalein. According to the operator's accident report, the pilot-in-command viewed the nose gear alignment marks in the nose gear inspection window and believed the nose gear was down and locked, and that the gear unsafe light was an erroneous indication. During the landing rollout, the nose landing gear slowly collapsed as the weight of the aircraft settled on the nose. The operator's investigation revealed a failure in the boss area on the extend end of the nose gear actuator. The operator also determined that the flight crew did not complete the emergency gear extension procedure as specified in the Airplane Flight Manual. During recovery of the aircraft from the runway the emergency gear extension hand pump lowered and locked the nose gear in 8 strokes of the pump.

Probable Cause and Findings
The failure of the flight crew to properly execute the emergency landing gear extension procedure in response to a landing gear unsafe cockpit indication.

After the vibrations the crew observed that the #2 engine (Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-50) had a higher-than-normal T5 temperature and a lower-than-normal torque indication.
The quick reference handbook items were carried out, which called for a precautionary shutdown of the #2 engine. The aircraft returned to CYZF and landed without further incident.
A subsequent inspection by the operator's maintenance revealed a damaged power turbine compressor. This aircraft had a previous precautionary engine shutdown due to vibrations, high T5 temperatures and low torque on 08 January 2024, after which the engine was removed and replaced. This was the aircrafts first flight post engine change."

There were no serious injuries among the 35 passengers and three crew members.
Braathens flight BRA 314 departed Trondheim-VÃ¦rnes Airport (TRD) at 18:13 on a domestic service to Ã…lesund, Bergen and Haugesund.
The flight between Trondheim and Ã…lesund was direct to the localizer for runway 25. The inbound tracking of the localizer for runway 25 is 237Â°M (magnetic). The off-set from the runway direction was due to the presence of high terrain northeast of the airport. The pilot in command initially tracked the localizer inbound. Reaching Final Approach at 1300 ft, he changed the course to track the extended runway centerline. To follow this track in the crosswind, a crab angle of approximately 15Â° into the wind was required.
After stabilizing on the centerline to runway 25, the crab angle was varying between 18,5Â° and 10,5Â°. The touch-down was at a heading of 238Â°M (runway direction 248,5Â°M), with a crab angle of 10,5Â°. Touchdown speed was 95 knots.
The aircraft touched down twice. Following the first touch-down on the runway centerline, the aircraft was became airborne again for approximately 2 seconds before making the final landing.
Then the pilot in command felt that the aircraft was affected by a ""force"" starting a left turn he could not control, either using flight controls or using brakes and nose wheel steering. A pronounced vibration was felt.
After traversing 300 m along runway 25 the aircraft crossed the runway shoulder, travelled across even ground covered with short grass for about 70 m before crossing taxiway D. From the edge of the taxiway the ground was rough with shrub and rocks. The aircraft came to rest about 20 m from the taxiway after suffering failure of the right main landing gear which had been bent backwards, and right hand propeller had contacted the ground.

Factors considered to have had relevance to the sequence of events and cause:
1. When touching down the pilot in command had not eliminated the crab angle of about 10Â°, and the aircraft was landed with a corresponding skid.
2. The pilot in command's method of attempting directional control by the use of nosewheel steering immediately following the touch-down, was not correct, and not in accordance with company operational procedures.
3. The pilot in command did not use rudder to its maximum efficiency during the landing.

an object was seen to fall from the aircraft. It was subsequently confirmed that the object was the right inner mainwheel. Fuel was burned off, and the aircraft then landed back at Norwich at 1405 hrs,
without further incident. The aircraft was removed from the runway to a hangar and jacked for
inspection. The detached wheel was recovered for examination. Apart from the separation of the
wheel, there was no other damage to the aircraft.

The departure from Kota Kinabalu was delayed by approximately 30 minutes due to late arrival of the aircraft. The flight took off from Kota Kinabalu at 04:19 UTC.
The descent into Tawau from the cruising altitude of 10500 feet was initiated at about 21 DME. At 05:01 UTC as the flight reported leaving 9000 feet and passing 16 DME, the flight crew advised the controller that they had the airfield visual. MH2133 was then cleared for visual approach runway 17.
At 05:02:48, MH2133 reported passing 3500 feet. The aircraft was then configured for landing where landing gears were selected down and flaps set at 25 degrees. The aircraft speed was still fast and since it was also high on the approach, the commander assured the co-pilot â€œRunway is long so no problem Ehâ€. On passing 2000 feet and on short final, the co-pilot reminded the commander â€œspeed, speed check, speed check Ahâ€.
The rate of descent was in excess of 3000 feet per minute and its pitch angle was around minus 13 degrees. The excessive rate of descent triggered the aircraft Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) sink rate and pull up warnings. The commander ignored these warnings and insisted that he should continue with approach for a landing.
The aircraft first touched down on the runway at 05:05 hrs. Its first tyre marks (nose wheel) on the runway was at approximately 3400 ft from the threshold. It then bounced and at 4500 ft point, its left main wheel made a light contact with the runway surface. It subsequently bounced up again and its main wheels made a firm contact at 4800 ft point, thus leaving only 800 ft of runway remaining.
The aircraft continued onto the grass verge, momentarily left the ground and hopped over the runway perimeter fence. It subsequently crashed at 571 feet from the end of the runway at almost right angle to the runway.
There were a number of explosions followed by a fire. The aircraft was totally destroyed.

Cause
The most probable cause of the accident was due to the commanderâ€™s insistence to continue with an approach despite the fact that the runway available after touchdown was not sufficient enough for the aircraft to stop.
The perception regarding economic consideration which put pressure on him to save fuel and adhere to schedules was a contributing factor.

At
0841 hrs, as the aircraft was approaching FL 065 in the descent, the crew contacted the
Humberside approach controller. He initially cleared the aircraft to descent to 1,700 feet and later,
with other instrument pattern traffic in sight, the flight was further cleared to turn for a left base to
join visually for Runway 21. The weather was fine with a surface wind of 150Â°/07 kt, visibility 7
km and a temperature of 4Â°C with clear sky conditions.

At 0843 hrs the crew called 'visual' with the runway and were transferred to the aerodrome
controller. At the time, engineering work was being carried out to replace a faulty centerline
runway light with engineers working by the runway edge and on the runway centerline itself. The
controller, using the ground movement frequency, instructed the lighting engineers ""BACK
FROM THE RUNWAY IMMEDIATELY PLEASE"". An engineer replied ""THERE'S A HOLE IN THE
MIDDLE...TOWER DO YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE THIS HOLE"". The controller continued ""THERE
SHOULDN'T BE A HOLE WE'VE GOT TRAFFIC LANDING"". Somewhat concerned, the engineer
transmitted again ""SAY AGAIN DO YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE IT OR DO YOU WANT ME TO FILL IT
BACK IN"". The controller replied ""HAVE TO BE LEFT NOW THERE'S AN AEROPLANE LANDING GET
BACK TO THE RUNWAY EDGE PLEASE"". The engineer responded ""THERE'S A LAMP ON THE
CENTRELINE AS WELL..THERE'S A LAMP OUT ...AND ITS JUST ADJACENT TO THE CENTRELINE"".

As they checked in on frequency the Fokker 50 crew was advised by the controller ""INFORMATION
FOR YOU IF YOU ARRANGE YOUR NOSE WHEEL TO BE EITHER TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT OF
RUNWAY CENTRELINE DUE TO A LAMP WHICH IS OUT OF POSITION IN THE CENTRELINE I'M
INFORMED"". The crew asked for a confirmation of message and were told by the controller ""YES IT'S
BEEN REMOVED...THEY HAVE REMOVED IT SO IT'S ONE OF THE CENTRELINE LIGHTS THAT'S JUST
ABOUT 100 METRES BEYOND THE PAPIs SO IF YOU ARRANGE FOR YOUR NOSE WHEEL TO BE EITHER
RIGHT OR LEFT OF THAT"". The crew acknowledged that they would comply with the instruction.

At 0846 hrs the controller cleared the aircraft to land. It is believed that the commander accepted the landing clearance in the belief that he could easily avoid what he assumed to be a small hole left by the removal of the centreline light. The landing was uneventful and nothing unusual was seen by the crew until the aircraft flared for landing. As they back-tracked the runway the crew informed the
tower that ""HE'S THE LAMP SITTING OUT ON THE RUNWAY IT'S GOT SOME KIND OF METAL TOOL
STICKING OUT UP INTO THE AIR...AND ALL SORTS OF CABLE ON THE RUNWAY...""

The controller replied that he was not fully aware of the situation and was under the impression that
the engineers were just changing a light bulb. Three minutes after the landing the aerodrome
controller contacted the airfield engineers again and instructed them to ""..GET THAT LAMP FILLED IN
IMMEDIATELY AND RETIRE FROM THE RUNWAY"".

After parking on stand the aircraft was inspected by ground engineers and the crew but no damage
was found. Inspection of the runway revealed that the displaced centreline light assembly and its
associated lifting handle and cable were also undamaged. The aircraft commander informed ATC,
however, that he would forward an Air Safety Reportto the Safety Data Department of the CAA.

nosewheel oleo appeared to be at full extension. The cabin staff checked the holds and reported that
they were both full. Both engines were secured and the commander instigated a check of the aircraft
loading. This revealed that, although the load sheet recorded that 403 kg was in the front hold (No 1)
and 158 kg was in the rear hold (No 2), the actual loads were reversed. This loading resulted in the
centre of gravity being well outside limits.

An investigation was initiated by the aircraft operator and the handling company. This confirmed
that the loading instructions were correct but that the loading crew incorrectly loaded the aircraft.
The dispatcher did not then check that the loading was correct before presenting the load sheet to
the commander.

After the landing gear was selected down but the crew noticed that the left main landing gear showed an unsafe indication. The captain decided to carry out a go-around. Before initiating the go-around manoeuvre he asked the first officer to consult the 'MAIN GEAR UNSAFE AFTER DOWN SELECTION' check list to see whether he
should raise the gear. The gear was then raised during the go-around. The aircraft was instructed to climb to 3000 feet and entered the Epsom NDB holding point at 12:01. Recycling the gear was also unsuccessful. The first officer then left the flight deck to check visually if the left main gear was down and locked. His inspection showed that the gear was not in a safe condition. The 'Alternate Down Procedure' was followed, but this was also unsuccessful. The captain then carried out a level '2g' (60° bank) turn at 170 kt. This manoeuvre, however, did not affect the left main gear unsafe indication. At 12:12 the crew decided to perform an emergency landing. After preparing the cabin for the emergency landing, the crew intercepted the ILS to runway 09R. The aircraft's touchdown was normal, right mainwheel first. About 5 seconds after all the landing gear were in ground contact the left main landing gear collapsed and the aircraft left
wing tip, left propeller and the rear left portion of the fuselage contacted the runway. The aircraft veered to the left coming to rest on the hard surface clear of the runway in Block 81.

An estimated 50 to 100 armed guerrillas herded the passengers into nearby boats on the Magdalena River. The guerrillas then took their hostages into the remote jungle area.

reported by the incoming crew. After a visual examination and discussions with ground engineering
staff, and in view of the fact that the aircraft had operated 4 sectors already in that condition, the
commander of the outbound flight decided to accept the aircraft. The first officer and cabin crew
were informed of the problem, the latter primarily to ensure that they were seated during taxiing.

The engine start was normal, except that the right engine start was delayed until after pushback
because of a strong wind from directly behind the aircraft on the stand. Upon starting to taxi, with
the first officer handling, the brakes were tested and appeared to function normally. They continued
to function normally during the subsequent taxi for Runway 05. However, since there was a strong
gusting tailwind, and to avoid the possibility of an engine tailpipe fire warning, additional power
was used during taxiing with the brakes being used to maintain an acceptable speed. The aircraft
was then stopped at holding point HA and the park brake was applied.

After a short time at the hold, the No 2 cabin crew member entered the flight deck and reported that
there was a fire on the left hand wheels. The commander ordered an evacuation and instructed the
first officer to carry out the ground evacuation drills. He also informed ATC that they had a brake
fire and were evacuating the passengers. The aircraft electrical power was switched off, and the
emergency lights switched on. No passenger address announcement was made, since it was
apparent that the evacuation was already well under way. Having opened his cockpit window to
look back at the left wheels and seen that the outer tyre had deflated, with a small fire burning
around the outer brake unit, the commander decided that there was no need to activate the engine
fire extinguishers. By that stage, all of the passengers appeared to have evacuated and so he
instructed the first officer to leave the aircraft and help assemble the passengers. However, realising
that he had received no acknowledgement from ATC, the commander then switched on the
batteries again, but upon hearing ATC transmissions which made it evident that his transmission
had been received, he made a further transmission informing ATC that the evacuation had been
completed, before switching off the batteries again and leaving the aircraft. By this time, the fire
was almost extinguished and he joined the passengers and the rest of the crew, who confirmed that
all passengers had left the aircraft and that there were no injuries. The Airport Fire Service arrived
shortly afterwards, but by that time the fire had extinguished. After liaising with the Fire Chief, the
commander re-entered the aircraft to retrieve the landing gear pins, and then fitted them. After
further liaison, the passengers were allowed back on board, under supervision, to recover their
personal effects before being taken by bus to the terminal.

An evacuation order was issued for the remaining passengers on the plane. Nobody was injured.

Probable Cause:
A higher than normal power setting on the brakes lead to the overheating of the Brakes.

The aircraft had a full load of passengers which meant that there would be little time for the cabin crew to carry out full service program on the shorter than normal flight.
After departure the seat belt sign remained on for approximately five minutes due to turbulence in the climb-out. Ten minutes before landing, when the commander turned on the ""fasten seat belt sign"", two cabin attendants were standing in the aft galley stowing their service carts. One cabin attendant was leaning slightly forward to lock a cart in place when the aircraft was through about in the turbulence. She flew up in the air and landed on the floor on her back with the right leg under her. She received help during the remainder of the flight and was then brought to hospital. After examination in the hospital it was determined that she had suffered three fractures in her right ankle.


Conclusion
Turbulence was experienced during the flight. The sudden severe shaking that was felt caused the C/A to lose her balance and fall, breaking her ankle. Contributing to the accident onboard was the fact that the short flight time provided little opportunity for the cabin attendants to complete the normal service program for a fully seated flight and then be seated with their seat belts fastened in good time prior to the landing. SHK considers that the need for serving a complete service program on short flights in turbulent weather can be questioned from a safety point of view.

The aircraft was flying a blind approach from the â€œSkagiâ€ radio beacon towards runway 20. Since the glide path indicator was inactive, the final approach was conducted using the localizer and distance measuring equipment (DME). The aircraft came out of the clouds at 1500 feet altitude, and the last few miles of the landing approach were guided by the runwayâ€™s Visual Approach Slope Indicator System (VASIS).
The approach speed was normal according to the captain, but at around 500 feet, the aircraft was above the intended approach path. The first officer then pointed the aircraftâ€™s nose down and reduced engine power to nearly idle. This caused the aircraft to descend rapidly. The first officer reduced the descent rate too late, leading to a hard landing on the runway, followed by the aircraft bouncing back into the air. The captain then intervened, landing the aircraft normally and taxiing it to the apron.


Flight conditions were good, and weather is not considered to have contributed to the accident. The glide path indicator for the runway was inactive, but a safe approach should have been possible given the available equipment.

The investigation into the accident revealed that the approach was not stable after descending below 500 feet, even though Icelandair's operations manual specifies that the approach should be aborted if it is not stable. When the co-pilot reduced power at around 500 feet and pointed the aircraftâ€™s nose down, the descent rate increased to as much as 1400 feet per minute, and the nose-down attitude was maintained until an altitude of 20 feet. The co-pilot then tried to reduce the descent rate by pitching the aircraft up, and it touched the runway with a +7Â° nose-up attitude. The engines were almost at idle power, which caused significant drag from the propellers, increasing the descent rate.

According to Icelandair's standard procedures, the captain should have intervened and aborted the landing before the situation escalated. The flight recorder shows that the g-load during the landing was +3.17 G.


METAR:

According to the METAR weather report, the wind was 170Â° at 12 knots, visibility was 9 km, clouds were broken at 1500 feet and 2100 feet, temperature was +11Â°C, dew point was +11Â°C, and QNH was 1007 hPa. The tower reported wind at 190Â°/12 knots and later 200Â°/10 knots.

The en-route segment of the flight was uneventful. A standard ILS approach was flown to runway (RWY) 17 at EICK. Shortly after landing, the aircraft weather-cocked right, into wind and drifted towards the right-hand side of RWY 17/35. The aircraft departed the right-hand side of the paved runway surface approximately 305 metres south of the intersection of both runways and continued on over soft ground for a further 195 metres, before finally coming to a stop. There were no injuries. The aircraft suffered some minor propeller and tyre damage. Some additional damage was caused to the runway infrastructure.

Causes
Directional control of the aircraft was lost as a result of aquaplaning, which was induced by the presence of standing water in the general area of the intersection.
The lack of a formalized procedure at Cork Airport to detect and report the presence of standing water on the runway.
Use of a landing roll out technique, which was inappropriate for crosswind, wet runway conditions.

10 Nov 2000,Fokker 50,SE-LIR,Skyways Express,0,Gällivare Airport (GEV/ESNG),sub,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/426492,Fokker 50,F50,17:22,20151,P&W Canada PW125B,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 52,0,Accident,Landing,Passenger - Scheduled,Stockholm-Arlanda Airport (ARN),GÃ¤llivare Airport (ESNG),"The aircraft was operated by Skyways Express AB on its scheduled flight, JZ206, between the Stockholm/Arlanda and GÃ¤llivare. The co-pilot was the flying pilot for the flight and was sitting in the left seat as he was undergoing route training in connection with his upgrade to commander. The commander, who also was the route-training instructor, sat in the right seat for the flight.
The flight to GÃ¤llivare was normal. The normal flap setting for landing is 25 degrees. However the pilots had agreed to perform the landing using a 35 degree flap setting for training purposes. When the aircraft was 40 feet (approx 12 m) above the runway the co-pilot commenced the round out prior to landing. The commander felt that the aircraft rounded out to high and was losing speed far too fast whereby he grasped the control column, pushed it forward and then released it. The aircraft levelled off for a short time and then sank rapidly from about 10 ft (3 m) above the runway, making firm contact with the runway. The co-pilot held on to the control column during the landing although he had interpreted the commanderâ€™s intervention as his taking control, despite his not reporting â€œMy controlsâ€.
Neither the commander nor the co-pilot felt it necessary afterwards to report the landing as being hard. No note was made in the aircraft log and no special inspection of the aircraft was asked for or done. The commander wrote in the co-pilots training syllabus that he should be more aware of rounding out too early during the landing.
About a day later after the aircraft had flown six more flights, substantial structural damage was found to the aft section of the aircraft.
The investigation has shown that the landing was made in a somewhat uncontrolled fashion and that contact with the runway was made with an unusually nose high attitude. Communication between the pilots during the landing sequence has also not followed standard procedure.
The fact that the damage was in a vulnerable area and also was so visible indicates that there are shortcomings in the pre-flight inspection process.
The accident was caused by a breakdown in communication between the pilots in connection with the landing. Additional factors that led to the outcome of the accident were the fact that the landing was carried out in darkness, that the co-pilot was not familiar with flying from the left seat and that the landing was made with a 35 degree flap setting.

The flight was at an altitude of 17,000 feet. Shortly before the aircraft began to descend, approximately over the northern coast of BreiÃ°afjÃ¶rÃ°ur, just south of the ReiphÃ³lsfjÃ¶ll Mountains, it flew into a dense, wind-swept bank of clouds. Within a few minutes, the aircraft developed a very heavy build-up of ice, for example on the engine air intakes, causing significant operational disruptions. Ice then built up on the windscreens and would not come off. The aircraft was turned around and out of the bank of clouds and the flight was reduced. The sea level temperature had by then reached near freezing, so it was not possible to de-ice the aircraft. Due to heavy snowfall in ReykjavÃ­k and KeflavÃ­k, the aircraft was flown to EgilsstaÃ°ir and landed there at 15:22. The weather en route to EgilsstaÃ°ir was good and information was received about this from FXI-336, which had flown that route shortly before.

At the scheduled departure time, the crew was informed by Air Traffic Control of a short delay to their start-up. Also at this time a mechanic from Martinair (the contracted maintenance organisation for KLM Cityhopper) plugged his headset into the external service/interphone panel located on the right side of the fuselage, below the first officerâ€™s cockpit sliding window. The mechanic remained in this position during the start delay period. When the start-up of both engines was completed, external power was removed from the aircraft and the first flight of the day before taxi scan was commenced. During this scan the first officer who was pilot flying activated the aircraft de-icing boots. The captain and first officer both visually checked the proper inflation of the de-icing boots on their respective wings and the first officer asked the mechanic to look at the tail section. A short time later a strange noise was heard apparently from the engines. At the same time the ground crew who was assisting with the external power, ran around the front of the aircraft nose and signalled frantically to the duty officer who was sitting in a vehicle parked near the aircraft nose on the captainâ€™s side. The duty officer came out of his vehicle, looked under the aircraft, and immediately gave a hand signal to the captain to cut the engines. The mechanic had walked through the edge of the right propeller and had sustained serious injuries.

Causes
The following causal factors were identified:
â€¢ The mechanic had to perform a task for which he was not properly trained.
â€¢ The GWK allowed the mechanic to dispatch the aircraft on his own.
â€¢ The mechanic reacted on impulse to proceed to the aircraft tail.
â€¢ Due to the light conditions the mechanic did not see the propeller.
Contributing factors were:
â€¢ Neither KLC nor MME defined specific instructions for executing the visual de-icing boots check.
â€¢ There was insufficient consideration by KLC and MME organisations of the risks involved prior to the introduction of the de-icing boots check.
â€¢ There was no formal system in place for the GWK to correctly assess the capability of the mechanic.
â€¢ The mechanic did not have any line experience with propeller aircraft.
â€¢ There were no visual warnings marking the danger areas of the propeller.
â€¢ The APU was not allowed to be used to check the de-icing boots inflation system prior to engine start.
â€¢ The light conditions may have made it difficult to see the tail section of the aircraft.
The underlying causes were:
â€¢ The absence of a hazard inventory and â€“evaluation of the functions of departure service personnel as integral part of the company safety management system.
â€¢ Insufficient supervision on the enforcement of the Occupational Safety and Health Act

At 09:50 Frankfurt control cleared the crew to descend to FL90 and told them to contact Luxembourg Approach control. Contact was established at 09:52 and Luxembourg Approach replied: ""Luxair niner six four two enter Diekirch holding at flight level niner zero it will be vectors later on for an ILS approach category two on two four. QNH is one zero two tree current RVR beginning two five zero on mid section two seven five, stop end two two five."". Six minutes later the controller cleared LG9642 to descend further down to 3000 feet. At 10:01 the flight was cleared for the approach: ""Luxair niner six four two turn right heading two two zero to intercept. Cleared for approach, report established on the localizer."" After passing the localizer the crew contacted Luxembourg Tower and reported being established on a runway 24 ILS approach. The tower controller then passed on the runway visual range (RVR) information, which had not changed. The crew reported that they needed 300 metres for the approach, to which the controller replied : ""Nine six four two copied, uh, so continue approach I keep you advised. We didn't have three hundred, uh, during the last, uh, time."". The approach was continued, but at 10:04:46 the captain decided to discontinue the approach: ""Yo, bon mir machen en goaround, missed approach"". The co-pilot then said: ""Ground idle stop off"". Four seconds after this statement the Tower controller reported the RVR to be 300 metres. Immediately engine power was reduced to idle and the co-pilot radioed: ""Nine six four two roger so we continue"". The tower then cleared the flight to land. The gear and flaps were lowered and at 10:05:17 the left prop blade angle changed from 'normal' to 'low pitch', causing the pilot to say:""Wat ass dat"" (What's that??). Almost immediately the right prop blade angle also went into low pitch. The flaps were raised several sounds and exclamations were recorded by the CVR the decrease in propeller revolutions and GPWS warnings. Both engines then failed as the Fokker descended. The airplane collided with terrain and caught fire.

CAUSES: ""The initial cause of the accident was the acceptance by the crew of the approach clearance although they were not prepared to it, namely the absence of preparation of a go-around. It led the crew to perform a series of improvised actions that ended in the prohibited override of the primary stop on the power levers.
Contributory factors can be listed as follows:
1. A lack of preparation for the landing, initiated by unnecessary occupations resulting from an obtained RVR value, which was below their company approved minima, created a disorganisation in the cockpit, leading to uncoordinated actions by each crewmember.
2. All applicable procedures as laid down in the operations manual were violated at some stage of the approach. All this did not directly cause the accident, but created an environment whereby privately designed actions were initiated to make a landing possible.
3. Routine and the will to arrive at its destination may have put the crew in a psychological state of mind, which could be the origin of the deviations from standard procedures as noticed.
4. The low reliability of the installed secondary stop safety device that was favoured by the non-application of service bulletin ABSC SB F050-32-4. Also the mode of distribution of the safety information (Fokker Aircraft B.V. - Service letter137) to the operator as well as the operatorÂ’s internal distribution to the crews, that did not guarantee that the crews were aware of the potential loss of secondary stop on propeller pitch control.
5. The lack of harmony resulting from the use of various training centres and non-standardised programs that might have impaired the synergy of the crew.""

The Fokker took off from MÃ¡laga at 11:32 for a cross-Mediterranean flight to the Spanish enclave of Melilla. The aircraft climbed to its assigned cruising altitude of FL130. After contacting Melilla tower at 11:48 the crew were told to start the descent on their own discretion and to expect a runway 33 approach. A company flight was second on approach and requested runway 15 for landing. The ATC asked the crew of PH-FZE ""would you admit to use one five or do you prefer to keep on runway three three?"" The question was repeated and it took some time for the crew of PH-FZE to answer: ""We can accept runway one five"" at 11:56. They were then cleared to runway 15 with wind 250Â° and 11 kt. Four minutes later the aircraft was cleared to land with wind 240Â° at 12 kt varying between 210Â° and 300Â°. Due to the runway change, the pilot in command had decided to land with flaps 35Â° and a reference speed of 95 KIAS. The aircraft made some S-turns to lose altitude because it was a little high in the approach path. The airplane overflew the displaced threshold of runway 15 at approximately 15 ft. During the landing, the pilot in command realised that he could not engage the propeller ground idle/reverse, he said ""I have no reverse"" and applied brakes in an attempt to stop the aircraft. Later on, the co-pilot also applied brakes. During the landing roll the aircraft did not decelerate as expected. The wheel number 3 became locked and was deflated by a flat spot. The aircraft started to veer to the left of the runway until wheel number 1 left the runway at around 150 m before the end of the 1347 m long runway. The Fokker continued down an embankment of around 15 m in height and came to rest against the airport perimeter fence. The fuselage broke near seat rows 6 to 8, and the floor was heavily deformed between those rows. After the aircraft came to a stop, the captain had been injured, and the crew members were frozen for a while, until the flight observer pilot who was in the jump seat stated that the occupants should leave the aircraft immediately and started carrying out the on-ground emergency checklist. He pulled both fire handles and tried to close both fuel levers, but he was unable to close those levers. Then the captain turned on the evacuation lights. In the mean time, after a while and in absence of commands from the cockpit, the rear flight attendant instructed the passengers, who were all seated in the rear part of the cabin, to leave the aircraft through door 2R, which opened without problem.

CAUSES: ""It is considered that the accident probably happened because of a combination of three factors:
1. An unstable approach that resulted in a higher than normal touchdown speed.
2. The inability to select propeller reverse due to the probable tripping of the circuit breaker FLIGHT IDLE SOLENOID 1 & 2 before or at touchdown.
3. The cross connection of the wheel speed transducer wire harness of wheels 3 and 4, which, due to heavy braking, produced a flat spot in wheel 3 and reduced the braking capability of wheel 4.""

A Fokker 50 passenger plane, operated by Kish Air, was destroyed when it crashed near Sharjah Airport (SHJ), United Arab Emirates. All six crew members and 37 of the 40 passengers were killed.
The aircraft was operating as a scheduled flight from Kish Island, Iran to Sharjah, UAE with the captain initially as the pilot flying (PF).
During the cruise and just prior to descent, the captain unexpectedly handed over control of the aircraft to the First Officer prior to the approach to Sharjah. The first officer did not accept this willingly and stated that he was not confident of his ability to conduct a VOR/DME approach into Sharjah. This statement was not consistent with his previous experience and could indicate either a cultural or professional issue. The captain insisted the first officer fly the aircraft and encouraged and instructed him during the approach.
At 11:24 hours local time, the aircraft contacted Dubai Arrivals and was cleared from 9000 ft to 5000 ft and instructed to expect a VOR/DME approach to runway 12 at Sharjah International Airport. At 11:29 hours the aircraft was further cleared to 2500 ft and cleared for the approach. The aircraft was under its own navigation and the daylight conditions were fine with excellent visibility. At 11:35 hours the aircraft was instructed to contact Sharjah Tower and the pilot reported that the aircraft was established on the VOR final approach for runway 12. The Tower cleared IRK7170 to land and advised that the wind was calm.
At that point the aircraft was slightly above the approach profile. The initial speed for the approach was at least 50 kt high at approximately 190 kt with no flap and no landing gear. The aircraft should have been configured with landing gear down and flap 10Â° during the approach and stabilized at 130 kt prior to the MDA. Approaching the MDA at flight idle setting, the auto-pilot was disengaged and the first Officer called for flap 10 at 186 kt (limiting speed of 180 kt) and flap 25 was selected by the Captain, a setting uncalled for by the Pilot Flying at 183 kt (limiting speed of 160 kt), and the landing gear was called for and selected at approximately 185 kt (limiting speed of 170 kt). The captain then took control of the aircraft and shortly afterwards the ground range selectors were heard by Cockpit Voice Recorder to be lifted and the power levers moved from the flight idle stop into the ground control range.
The left propeller then went to full reverse whilst the right propeller remained in positive pitch within the ground control range. The aircraft descended in an extreme nose low left bank attitude until impact. The aircraft crashed 2.6 nm from the runway onto an unprepared sandy area adjacent to a road and residential buildings. The aircraft broke apart on impact and a fire started immediately.

Cause:
The power levers were moved by a pilot from the flight idle position into the ground control range, which led to an irreversible loss of flight control.
Contributory Causes:
1. By suddenly insisting the First Officer fly the final approach, the pilot in command created an environment, which led to a breakdown of crew resource management processes, the non observance of the operatorÂ’s standard operating procedures and a resultant excessive high approach speed.
2. An attempt to rectify this excessive high approach speed most likely resulted in the non compliance with the Standard Operating Procedures and the movement of the power levers below flight idle.
3. The unmodified version of the Skid Control Unit failed to provide adequate protection at the time of the event."

The weather information the flight crew had for ÃsafjÃ¶rÃ°ur Airport was as follows: Wind 50 degrees (northeast) 20-33 knots, visibility four kilometers, snowing, light clouds at 800 feet, mostly cloudy at 1,500 feet and air pressure 990 hPa.

The flight from ReykjavÃ­k Airport was routine, but due to visibility, a holding flight was flown at the Reykjanes School NDB before flying along the centerline beacon (LLZ) to Ã–guri (OG LLZ/DME) according to the instrument flight chart for ÃsafjÃ¶rÃ°ur Airport as can be seen in Figure 1 below. Approximately 6 nautical miles and at an altitude of about 500 feet northwest of Ã–guri, the aircraft landed in severe turbulence and at the same time the crew received a warning from the aircraft's ground control system about terrain nearby and an order to climb (TERRAIN AHEAD PULL UP PULL UP). The aircraft's autopilot failed due to the turbulence. The warning caused the crew to doubt the reliability of the navigation instruments, immediately abort the approach, begin a go-around, and climb on course 331 out of ÃsafjÃ¶rÃ°ur Deep.

Due to the turbulence in ÃsafjarÃ°ardjÃºpur, the crew decided to return to ReykjavÃ­k Airport. The Air Accident Investigation Board was notified of the incident by the pilot and the flight operations manager of FlugfÃ©lag Ãslands, and the flight recorders of the aircraft were taken for reading.

Flight recorder readings indicated that there was considerable turbulence in ÃsafjarÃ°ardjÃºp. The aircraft lost about 270 feet of altitude at the time the autopilot disengaged. Subsequently, a deviating flight was initiated. The minimum indicated airspeed (IAS) was 145 knots and the maximum was 160 knots. The maximum vertical acceleration was +1.8G (m/s2) and the minimum was +0.5G (m/s2).

Passengers were briefed to fasten seatbelt when passing through FL110. SK 2322 was cleared descent to 5000 feet, to expect a visual approach to RWY25. In clouds, descending through 7000 feet they experienced moderate to severe turbulence for a few seconds. Considering the weather, the flight crew had not expected this kind of turbulence. Passengers were briefed about the turbulence and when contacting the cabin crew she told the flight crew that she was hurt and sitting down ready for landing. After landing, cabin crew remained seated while the passengers were disembarked by the co-pilot. An ambulance was requested, and the cabin crew was transferred to the hospital in Kristiansund.

This request was approved with the remark to initially remain east of the airport and clear of final of runway 21. This was confirmed by the pilot of D-FUKK. Despite this manoeuvre both aircraft approached each other at a distance of approximately 0.14 NM at almost the same altitude. Due to the weather the pilots crew did not have visual contact with the other aircraft.

CONCLUSION
The serious incident could happen because D-FUKK was mistakenly considered to be a helicopter.
Consequently the special VFR regulations were not correctly applied and the performance of the aircraft was not properly estimated. That is the reason why no adequate separation minima was provided.
Because of the weather conditions the pilot of D-FUKK did not have sufficient visual references for his position in relation to the airfield and the other aircraft.

They would counteract this with the rudder. As the aircraft landed it bounced, as it landed a second time the captain applied full right rudder in order to counteract the aircraft from veering toward the left. This though was executed on the idea that the captain had selected ground idle when in fact he had selected full reverse. This in turn caused the aircraft to continue veering toward the left. The aircraft eventually came to rest with the gear stuck in the mud. All passengers and crew disembarked safely and nobody suffered injuries.

Probable Cause:
The captainâ€™s failure to properly select idle caused the aircraft to continue veering off the runway.

Take-off and climb to Flight Level 250 was performed according to normal procedures.
During the flight, the crew requested information regarding weather conditions at the destination airport, partly via air traffic control and partly via the crew of a sister aircraft. According to the CVR, the crew received information on the latest current weather according to METAR at 00:56 hrs. The wind was stated to be 270 degrees, 25 knots and 39 knots in the gusts, and visibility to be 5000 metres in moderate rain.
Shortly thereafter, when the aircraft was abeam Jönköping, the warning for cabin pressure altitude was activated. The crew made an emergency descent to Flight Level 80 and performed the measures according to the checklist for emergency descent and cabin decompression. According to the CVR, both the crew members had begun to use oxygen masks within two minutes of the warning being triggered.
At the crew's request to descend to Flight Level 80 or 90, air traffic control gave the clearance ""descend to flight level 80"" without any further information. Two and a half minutes later, air traffic control communicated ""no traffic reported flight level 80"".
After this, the crew conducted an internal dialogue for just over ten minutes on the reduction of cabin pressure, which included reading the aircraft's operating manuals and performing an inspection of the cabin space.
At 01:23 hrs, the crew noted an ATIS broadcast with the time stamp 00:20 (UTC time) which, among other things, contained information that runway 17 was in use, wet runway, wind 280 degrees 21 max 33 knots and visibility 9 km in light rain and mist. The captain has explained that the detail of the wet runway was not understood because of simultaneous communication on another frequency. After consultation with the co-pilot, the captain made the decision to use runway 35.
The crew carried out a briefing and subsequently commenced the approach and implemented the associated checklist. At 01:41 hrs, clearance was received to land on runway 35 with the wind stated to be 280 degrees 26 knots max 34. The landing clearance was acknowledged by the crew. The sound recordings also show that the crew received the wind data.
According to the crew, the approach and touchdown were performed without problems. Shortly after touchdown, the engines were reversed. When the speed reduced, the aircraft began to yaw to the left. The captain explained that he used the nose wheel steering to compensate the yawing tendency but that the nose wheel ""probably went across"". Furthermore, he was unsure whether the brakes had been used.
The yaw continued towards the left, and the aircraft left the runway and stopped with the nose wheel and left main gear in the grass, with the right main gear on the asphalted runway shoulder. In connection with the excursion, the nose gear and left main gear each ploughed a furrow in the ground on the grass area with a depth corresponding to just under half the diameter of the wheels.

Factors as to Cause and Contributing Factors:
The incident was caused by the aircraft being suddenly subjected to a severe gust of wind during roll-out while maintaining thrust reversal.
Contributing factors were probably the crew's lack of sleep, which probably affected decision-making and attention, which in turn led to the landing being performed under conditions that exceeded the operator's crosswind limitations for the aircraft.

All four on board were killed.
The airplane departed runway 6 and climbed slowly attaining no more than about 50 feet above ground. The flight path continuously deviated left of the extended runway centerline at an airspeed of 100 knots, which was also the lift off airspeed. The airplane subsequently collided with the building, about 2.1 kilometers north-northeast of the runway departure end. The airplane impact attitude with the building was about a 120Â° left roll angle.
The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) data revealed aural warning alerts began about 8 seconds after the takeoff roll was initiated of which thereafter the flight crew also made reference to indications associated with visual warning alerts. However, despite the alerts the flight crew continued the takeoff. The flight data recorder data showed that no. 1 propeller rpm reduced from 100% to 50% where it stabilized at for the remainder of the flight. The decrease in propeller rpm corresponded with an increase of the no. 1 engine torque to about 110% along with the occurrence of the aural warning alerts. According to radar data, the liftoff occurred near the runway end. The no. 2 engine operated normally throughout the entire flight.
The day before the accident, the airplane was repositioned from Nairobi-Wilson Airport to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The flight was commanded by the accident captain. During that flight, the CVR data disclosed warning alerts similar to those of the accident flight accompanied by the flight crew discussion on the interpretation and significance of the alerts. The investigation did not reveal any actions undertaken before the accident to address any irregularities that may have been associated with the warning alerts during the repositioning flight.
Calculations of the aircraft weight and balance that included the post-accident measured weights of the cargo determined that at takeoff the airplane weight was about 500kg over the maximum certified gross weight.

Probable Cause:
The probable cause of the accident was the decision by the crew to conduct the flight with a known mechanical problem and their failure to abort or reject the takeoff after receiving twenty seven cautions.

Visual inspection by the crew revealed a large bird carcass hanging from the left main landing gear. At 10:55 the crew requested for diversion to Nairobi-Jomo Kenyatta Airport as they declared full emergency landing and was cleared to join base runway 06.
The crew subsequently decided to perform a gear up landing and landed the aircraft on runway 06 at about 11:02 skidding to a halt 2 km from the threshold on the runway. No injuries were reported.
A post removal inspection revealed evidence of a bird strike lodged into the left main gear structure.

Probable Cause: ""The cause of the accident was the failure of the left Main Landing Gear,MLG to extend during landing due to a bird strike which disabled proper functioning of the mechanical system that controls the opening and closing the door to the left MLG.""

21 Apr 2016,Fokker 50,OO-VLF,VLM Airlines,0,10 NM north-east of Friedrichshafen airport (EDNY),non,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/215961,Fokker 50,F50,10:14,20208,P&W Canada PW125B,Fatalities: 0 / Occupants: 33,0,Serious incident,Approach,Passenger - Scheduled,Berlin-Tegel Airport (TXL/EDDT),Friedrichshafen airport (EDNY),"On 21 April 2016, the second day of the aviation exhibition AERO-Friedrichshafen, the pilot of the pistoned-engine Piper PA-28RT-201T, registration OK-ELL, with three passengers on board, made initial contact at 08:03:27 UTC with the Friedrichshafen (EDNY) aerodrome control on frequency 120.075 MHz for landing. The pilot notified the air traffic controller that he had passed Kempten and was going to descend to 4000 ft QNH.
At the aerodrome control of Friedrichshafen Airport two air traffic controllers’ workstations were allotted with the descriptions VFR Pick-up, respectively PL-Main. After initial contact, the pilot of OK-ELL was instructed by the VFR Pick-up controller to fly directly towards the waypoint OSCAR, north-west of the airport, thereby remaining outside of the control zone (CTR).
Roughly four minutes later, the crew of a Fokker 50 with flight plan call sign VLM 22TX and 33 passengers on board, made initial contact with the radar executive (RE) air traffic controller of the approach control (APP). The latter then issued a heading and a descent clearance with the intention of guiding VLM 22TX via a right-hand base towards a waypoint situated on the extended centreline of runway 24 and approximately 11 NM from the threshold for an instrument approach.
When OK-ELL was roughly 20 NM east of the airport at an altitude of 4000 ft AMSL, the pilot was cleared by the VFR Pick-up aerodrome controller to join the final approach leg of runway 24.
At 08:12:49 UTC, the flight crew of flight VLM 22TX was cleared by the RE air traffic controller to descend to 5000 ft QNH. Half a minute later, they were cleared to turn to a heading of 150 degrees for the base leg, coupled with the clearance to descend to 4000 ft QNH.
After having been transferred to the PL Main air traffic controller, the pilot of OK-ELL called on frequency 134.300 MHz at 08:13:44 UTC on long final to runway 24. At 08:13:58 UTC, the PL Main aerodrome controller instructed the pilot of OK-ELL to turn right towards the waypoint OSCAR and to remain outside of the CTR.
At 08:14:06 UTC the ground based short term conflict alert (STCA) generated an alarm between VLM 22TX and OK-ELL, followed ten seconds later at 08:14:16 UTC by a traffic information provided to the flight crew of VLM 22TX by the RE air traffic controller concerning an unknown VFR traffic. He then provided a second traffic information at 08:14:37 UTC. Despite good visual meteorological conditions, the visibility through the flight deck windows of VLM 22TX was impaired by the reflection and position of the sun, which is why the flight crew could only identify and follow the intruding traffic at the same altitude with the information displayed by their traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS). The commander subsequently decided to initiate an avoidance manoeuvre by turning 90 degrees to the right.
At approximately the same time, following the traffic information, the pilot of OK-ELL reported that he had visual contact with the Fokker 50. During the avoidance manoeuvre of VLM 22TX, the two aircraft crossed at an altitude of approximately 4000 ft AMSL. The closest point of approach at 08:14:54 UTC was 0.5 NM horizontally und 100 ft vertically.
Both aircraft continued their approach without further events.

Causes:
The serious incident is attributable to a dangerous convergence of two aircraft flying on a converging course in airspace class E during an aviation exhibition, during which time the commercial aircraft flying under instrument flight rules was in contact with the approach control, while the light aircraft flying under visual flight rules was in radio contact with the aerodrome control.
The dangerous convergence arose from the concurrence of the following factors in chronological order:
- The operational concept consisting of the simultaneous approach of traffic under visual and instrument flight rules during the trade fair entailed systemic risks.
- The pilots of both aircraft were not in radio contact with the same air traffic control unit.
- The traffic guidance within the aerodrome control service concerning the light aircraft approaching under visual flight rules was coordinated inadequately.
- The traffic alert and collision avoidance system on board the commercial aircraft did not generate a resolution advisory due to a lateral avoidance manoeuvre.
- The traffic information provided by the aerodrome control to the pilot of the light aircraft was given too late.
- The pilots of both aircraft only acquired a late visual contact of each other.
The current classification of the airspace, in which the dangerous convergence took place, contributed to the occurrence of the serious incident.

The aircraft, a Fokker 50, operated by Amapola Flyg on behalf of Air VallÃ©e, departed Rimini at 08:49 on a domestic service to Catania. The aircraft was approaching runway 08 at Catania Airport when the nose landing gear failed to deploy. The approach was abandoned about 10:37 hours. The airplane climbed to 2900 feet and entered a holding pattern to the east of the airport while the crew tried to troubleshoot the problem.
Finally a forced landing was carried out on runway 08 at 11:34 with the nose gear doors open but the nose gear retracted.

CAUSES
The accident was caused by the failure of the nose landing gear (nose gear up) due to over-extension of the shock absorber which caused interference between the tires and the NLG compartment and locked the NLG in a retracted position.
The over-extension was caused by the incorrect installation of some internal components of the shock absorber during the replacement of the internal seals the day before the accident.

The following factors contributed significantly to the improper activity conducted at maintenance:
- the insufficient experience of technical personnel in carrying out the maintenance tasks conducted on the NLG;
- the lack of controls on the operations carried out, deemed unnecessary by the CAMO engineering department;
- the lack of definition of roles and tasks during the planning phase of the maintenance work;
- the operational pressure on maintenance personnel, arising from the need to conclude maintenance operations quickly in order not to penalize the management of the aircraft;
- the insufficient clarity and lack of sensitive information in the maintenance tasks and related figures contained in the AMM, regarding the replacement of internal shock absorber seals, subsequently made clearer by the manufacturer;
- the reported black and white printing of the applied AMM procedures, which could have made the warnings in the manual barely legible.

The airplane's warning system triggered a momentary alert during the initial phase of the takeoff run. The pilots heard the alert but did not have sufficient time to diagnose its origin. After liftoff, a failure occurred in the feathering system of the left propeller.
As a result, the propeller feathered but the engine continued to operate at high power. The captain, who was at the controls, continued to fly the airplane while the first officer shut down the left engine in accordance with the engine-out procedure.
The flight crew declared mayday, and air traffic control began to vector the airplane to the departure airport as requested by the flight crew. The flight was following a procedure that could have led to the airplane exiting controlled airspace, bringing it into conflict with a tall transmission tower. The controller responded by providing headings that ensured adequate separation from the tower.
The flight crew made preparations for landing on runway 15. They conducted the applicable checklists. On final approach, when the captain asked the first officer to lower the landing gear, the flight crew noticed that the gear had remained extended during the entire flight. The airplane landed at 17:19 h and taxied to the apron.

Conclusions:
- Upon signal interruption, the autofeather unit commanded feathering of the left propeller, but the engine continued to operate. Handling of similar situations is not drilled during pilot training.
- The pilots failed to raise the landing gear due to high workload and because they did not conduct the after takeoff checklist.
- Pilots should be trained to recognize and handle uncommanded feathering.
- Engine power cannot be used effectively, while the feathered propeller overstresses the engine.
- Both the pilot and the airline should ensure that the pilotâ€™s license contains a valid language proficiency endorsement to enable the pilot to exercise the privileges of a flight crew member.
- A frequency that enables communication between rescue service and flight crews will help both parties to build situational awareness. The frequency should be readily available for flight crews.
- Special attention must be paid on the condition and correct installation of connectors.
- Before issuing an alert, controllers should use the color of the alert form to determine the pushbutton to be operated.
- Air traffic controllers shall agree positively on the responsibility for controlling a flight.
- The appearance of the abbreviation EM in a radar label should be accompanied by an aural alert that would focus the controllerâ€™s attention to the emergency situation.

The crew ferried the aircraft from Nairobi-Wilson to NBO and on arrival, the aircraft was taxied to terminal 2-M22 where the chocks were placed and the Ground Power Unit connected. The captain reported that the crew then disembarked to perform walk rounds as per the relevant checklist from which no anomalies were reported.
The flight crew then proceeded to do their briefing with the ground handling personnel and gave the boarding clearance. On completion, the captain reported, having obtained the engine start clearance and requested the ground handlers to remove the GPU and the chocks. The GPU was, however, not clear at the time the aircraft began taxiing and consequently, the aircraft engine no.2 propeller impacted the GPU, causing the separation of two propeller blades and damage to the remaining four blades. Shrapnel penetrated the fuselage above RH window number 5.

The Captain immediately shut down the engines and commanded the cabin crew to evacuate the passengers to the terminal building as per emergency evacuation procedures.
The aircraft sustained substantial damage to its RH Engine and shrapnel penetrated the upper part of the fuselage above the RH window NUMBER 5. The GPU was damaged and no injuries were reported .

One crew member suffered serious injuries.

The flight from Panama City Albrook-Marcos A. Gelabert International Airport (PAC) was delayed approximately 3 hours due to prevailing weather conditions in the country.
For this flight, the first officer (FO) was the pilot flying (PF), and the captain was the pilot monitoring (PM). The flight proceeded uneventfully.
At 20:49 Flight 982 made first contact on with Bocas Del Toro Airport tower, reporting they were at GEMER. The tower reported moderate rain, calm wind, and a wet runway.
The pilot in command reported they would proceed to 10 NM to attempt an approach, and if it was not possible, they would return to Panama City.
At 20:55, the captain reported reaching 10 NM and stated they would continue the approach to KOMDI, to try to gain visual reference of the field.
At 20:58, the tower controller informed that there was lightning activity (CB) over the station. They had visual contact with the aircraft at approximately 4 NM, requested their distance, and the crew reported they were at KOMDI and had the field in sight. The flight was cleared for landing on runway 27, with calm wind and caution advised due to a wet runway.
After touchdown, the aircraft experienced a runway excursion to the right side. The aircraft crossed a ditch and the right-hand wing and tail section broke off. The left-hand wing was severely twisted.

The flight was cleared by the SÃ£o JosÃ© Tower controller to follow the 010 degrees radial to the SJC VOR, and cross the VOR at 5000 feet.
Some time after takeoff SÃ£o JosÃ© Tower instructed the flight to climb to FL280 out of 5000 feet and intercept the 352 radial of the SJC VOR. The flight crew failed to follow the instructions. This was not noticed when the crew contacted BrasÃ­lia ACC.
The airplane continued at 5000 feet until it struck a cloud covered mountain in the Mantiqueira Mountains at an elevation of 5000 feet, 700 feet below the peak.

PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Portuguese):
- The pilots did not plan the flight properly, though there was an AIS room with the necessary sources of consultation. Maintaining altitude of 5000 feet for too long a time, subject to the minimum safe altitudes in the are area in the available publications, and the discrepancies found in the flight plan confirm this thesis.
- The pilot did not properly collated the guidelines issued by the tower and remained incompatible altitude with instructions issued by the control.
- There are strong indications that the flight proceeded under instrument flight conditions.
- There was no proper coordination between the ACC BS and TWR SJ regarding the transference and control of the air traffic nor did TWR SJ requested receipt of the messages."

All sixteen occupants were killed.
The airplane operated Air France flight 1919 from Bordeaux, France to Brussel-Zaventem Airport (BRU), Belgium, and Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS), the Netherlands and return. However, poor weather at Amsterdam forced the crew to cancel the flight leg to Schiphol Airport.
AF1919 departed Brussels at 13:30 with the copilot as Pilot Flying and the captain as Pilot Monitoring. It reached the Bordeaux area without incident. The crew contacted Bordeaux Approach at 15:01 and were vectored for an ILS approach to runway 23. Visibility was poor with low clouds at 100 feet and a runway visual range (RVR) of between 650 and 350 metres.
Flight 1919 crossed the KERAG beacon, the initial approach fix (IAF) at an altitude of FL144, at 15:04:40. Cloud base was still around 100 feet so the crew requested to enter a holding pattern to the south of the airport. The weather conditions slightly improved during the next few minutes and Bordeaux Approach reported a cloud base at 160 feet. Flight 1919 had not reached the holding pattern yet and the pilot decided to attempt to rejoin the ILS. At 15:06:38 the flight was cleared direct to the BD beacon and to descend down to 2000 feet. At the BD beacon, the flight was cleared for final approach and instructed to contact Bordeaux Tower. The airplane had overshot the centreline and was slighty right on the glidepath. Bordeaux Tower then instructed the flight to report over the Outer Marker, which was acknowledged by the captain. After crossing the Outer Marker, the airplane was still not properly established on the ILS. The airplane descended below the glideslope with the crew hurriedly deploying flaps and landing gear. The captain did not contact Bordeaux Tower as requested. Instead he took over control of the airplane, attempting to continue the approach. Both crew members had very little time to adapt to their new roles as the airplane was descending below the glide slope. The descent continued until it struck trees and crashed at 15:10:18.

CAUSES (translated from French):
The accident was the direct result of poorly managed aircraft trajectory.
- The lack of vigilance with respect to altitude, by one pilot and then the other, when they were in a pilot-flying situation (PF, according to the Air Littoral Operations Manual) both when the aircraft descended out of the ILS beam through 2000 feet altitude and when it descended below 220 feet, the decision height.
- Inadequate coordination of tasks between the two pilots who formed the flight crew, neither of which had performed important tasks related to this function, such as monitoring and reporting ILS or altitude deviations, while in a nonpilot-flying situation (PNF, according to the same manual).

Before radar contact was established with atc, the EMB-120 converged with a Civil Air Patrol Cessna 172, n99501. The cessna was heading westbound toward the setting sun. Subsequently, a head-on collision occurred about 2-1/2 mi south of the airport. During impact, the right horizontal stabilizer of the EMB-120 separated from the a/c, but it continued flying to a safe landing. The Cessna, however, entered an uncontroled descent and crashed.

The crew of the EMB-120 reported that they saw the Cessna moments before impact. The captain said he took immediate evasive action by 'pushing' the nose down, but was unable to avoid a collision.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Inadequate visual lookout by the pilots of both aircraft, which resulted in their failure to see-and-avoid oncoming traffic. A factor related to the accident was: the sun's glare, which restricted the vision of the Cessna 172 pilot.""

It was to fly in formation with an DAT Embraer 120 Brasilia near Antwerp Airport (ANW).
The Brasilia, OO-DTH, departed LiÃ¨ge-Bierset Airport (LGG) at 17:57 and headed for Antwerp. Piper Aerostar N4PC took off from Antwerp at 18:43 and headed for Kallo, were both aircraft would join formation. It was agreed that the Aerostar would be on the left hand side of the EMB-120 because the camera crew was sitting on the right hand side of the Aerostar.
After circling the city of Antwerp, the crew of OO-DTH contacted the Antwerp air traffic controller, stating his intentions to carry out a low pass over runway 29, followed by a high speed pass. The Aerostar would be alongside OO-DTH on both occasions. After that they would break and continued to Brussels.
Antwerp Tower issued clearance at 19:06. At 19:08 OO-DTH radioed their plans to N4PC: ""I am starting approach and descent. I am going over the runway. I will not make a touch and go, I will just pull up, left and then back high speed."" The pilot of N4PC replied: ""OK... I will go straight ahead"".
At 19:11 both aircraft made a low pass over runway 29 at a speed of 140 kts. OO-DTh was climbing away in a left turn when a mid-air collision occurred with N4PC. The tail of the Machen was sheared off and the aircraft crashed out of control near a railway line. The Brasilia was able to make a safe emergency landing at Antwerpen.

WAARSCHIJNLIJKE OORZAKEN:

Geen voldoende zicht vanwege de piloten van OO-DTH tijdens of voor het uitoefenen van een manoeuver. (Scherpe klimmende bocht op lage hoogte).
- De gezagvoerder : bestuurde het vliegtuig en had aandacht nodig voor het uitvoeren van het manoeuver.
- De co-piloot : had de opdracht enkel de motorinstrumenten te controleren.

De onmogelijkheid van de piloot van N4PC om OO-DTH te zien tijdens de pull-up en scherpe bocht. De piloot zat in de normale linker zetel van het toestel. Uit die positie is het onmogelijk een vliegtuig dat van rechtsonder komt te zien.
De piloten namen onvoldoende voorzorgen om een aanvaring te vermijden.

2. Het uitvoeren van een manoeuver : steile bocht op lage hoogte van OO-DTH, wetende dat het andere vliegtuig in de onmiddellijke omgeving is, zonder werkelijk zijn juiste positie te kennen.

3. Een misverstand tussen de gezagvoerders te wijten aan een onvolledige voorbereiding van de opdracht, voornamelijk inzake afspraken betreffende het einde van de opdracht en het afbreken van de formatie.

4. Het foutief interpreteren van een radiobericht.
Om 17.08.06 UTC, op frekwentie 123.5 MHz. OO-DTH/N4PC.
OO-DTH ""... ik maak gewoon een pull up, links, en dan terug high speed"".
N4PC ""OK ... I continue straight ahead"".



translation from original Dutch-language report:


PROBABLE CAUSES:
1. The lack of visual contact between the crews of both aircraft.
Not enough sight of the pilots of OO-DTH during or before the execution of a manoeuver. (Sharp climbing turn at low altitude).
- The commander: controlled the plane and needed attention to perform the manoeuver.
- The co-pilot: the was instructed just to monitor the engine instruments.

The inability of the pilot of N4PC to observe OO-DTH during the pull-up and sharp bank. The pilot was in the usual left hand seat of the aircraft. From that position it is impossible to observe an aircraft approaching from right below.
The pilots took insufficient precautions to avoid a collision.

2. Performing a manoeuver: steep turn at low level of OO-DTH, knowing that the other aircraft was the immediate vicinity, without actually knowing the actual position.

3. A misunderstanding between the commanders due to incomplete preparation of the assignment, mainly on the agreement when to end the assignment and leaving the formation flight.

4. The erroneous interpretation of a radio message.
At 17.08.06 UTC on frequency 123.5 MHz. OO-DTH/N4PC.
OO-DTH ""... I just pull up, left, and then back high speed.
N4PC ""OK ... I continue straight ahead."

Hartsfield International Airport, GA (ATL/KATL)","Brunswick-Glynco Jetport, GA (BQK/KBQK)","Atlantic Southeast Airlines flight 2311, an Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia, crashed following a loss of control while on approach to Brunswick-Glynco Jetport, Georgia, USA, killing all 23 occupants.

Flight 2311 was scheduled initially for Embraer EMB-120RT Brasilia N228AS to depart at 13:24 EST. Because of mechanical problems an airplane change was made to N270AS. The flight departed Atlanta at 13:47 and arrived in the Brunswick area about 14:44. At 14:48 the flight was cleared for a visual approach to runway 07. The Embraer had just turned from base leg to final approach when the aircraft was seen to pitch up about 5 degrees and roll to the left until the wings were vertical. The airplane then nosed down into the ground, 9975 feet short of the runway.

The left propeller blade angle at the time of impact was about 3 degrees, which is below the range for normal flight. The right propeller blade angle was above the flight idle low pitch stop.
It was determined that the left propeller actuator did not respond to a PCU action to increase blade angle because the PCU quill spline teeth were severely worn and could not engage the transfer tube spline. The extreme and rapid wear of the nitrided quill spline teeth was the result of the sliding contact with the titanium nitrided surface of the transfer tube spline.
This harder titanium-nitrided coating on the transfer tube was selected by the manufacturer, Hamilton Standard, to improve manufacturing efficiency compared to the originally certificated nitrided transfer tube.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The loss of control in flight as a result of a malfunction of the left engine propeller control unit which allowed the propeller blade angles to go below the flight idle position. Contributing to the accident was the deficient design of the propeller control unit by Hamilton Standard and the approval of the design by the Federal Aviation Administration. The design did not correctly evaluate the failure mode that occurred during this flight, which resulted in an uncommanded and uncorrectable movement of the blades of the airplane's left propeller below the flight idle position.""

The second shift mechanics started working on the right hand deice boot. Although planned for the third shift, the 47 screws from the top of the left leading edge assembly for the horizontal stabilizer were already removed by the second shift. The third shift mechanics finished the replacement of the right hand deice boot but did not have time to replace the left hand boot as well.
The first flight was a 07:00 scheduled flight from Houston to Laredo.
Flight 2574 departed Laredo for the return leg to Houston at 09:09. The cruise portion of the flight was uneventful and at 10:03 the aircraft was descending through 11800 feet to 9000 feet when the air loads caused the left horizontal stabilizer leading edge to bend downward and separate. A sudden severe nose down pitchover occurred and the wings stalled negatively. A negative g of 3.5 was recorded by the FDR. Eyewitnesses reported a bright flash and saw the aircraft breaking up while descending in a flat left spin until impact.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The failure of Continental Express maintenance and inspection personnel to adhere to proper maintenance and quality assurance procedures for the airplane's horizontal stabilizer deice boots that led to the sudden in-flight loss of the partially secured left horizontal stabilizer leading edge and the immediate severe nose-down pitchover and breakup of the airplane. Contributing to the cause of the accident was the failure of the Continental Express management to ensure compliance with the approved maintenance procedures, and the failure of FAA surveillance to detect and verify compliance with approved procedures.""
NTSB board member John K. Lauber filed a dissenting statement on the investigation report, believing the probable cause should read as follows:
""1) The failure of Continental Express management to establish a corporate culture which encouraged and enforced adherence to approved maintenance and quality assurance procedures, and 2) the consequent string of failures by Continental Express maintenance and inspection personnel to follow approved procedures for the replacement of the horizontal stabilizer deice boots. Contributing to the accident was the inadequate surveillance by the FAA of the Continental Express maintenance and quality assurance programs.""

Due to the weather conditions in Ponta Grossa, a go-around was performed to circle and attempt landing on the opposite runway. During the approach the aircraft proceeded to the landing with the landing gear retracted.
The aircraft touched down on the runway with the landing gear retracted. The passengers and crew exited the aircraft after it had stopped, via the emergency exit, with no personal injuries sustained.


Contributing Factors
a. Human Factor
(1) Psychological Aspect:
The presence of this factor contributed to variables at the individual level, with no involvement of those that could be present at the psychosocial and organizational levels. Regarding the individual-level variables, they encompassed aspects of affectivity (anxiety), activity (disregard for established procedures), motivation (compulsion to land), attention (interruption of work sequence and fixation of attention), memory (forgetfulness), management (poor cockpit coordination), cognition (making the wrong decision), and finally, stress (excessive stimuli).

b. Material Factor
Did not contribute.

c. Operational Factor
(1) Deficient Maintenance and Supervision:
The repair service in the flap area was inadequate, indicating a failure in the quality of the inspection department.
The installation of an ""L/G Rezay Box"" with an incompatible part number compared to the one previously installed on the aircraft demonstrates a deficiency in control.

(2) Poor Cockpit Coordination:
The crew did not follow standardized and pre-established procedures, turning their actions into individual and uncoordinated acts.

(3) Adverse Weather Conditions:
Although the weather was within IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) minimums, it quickly became an adverse factor following the go-around, potentially leading to a hasty decision-making process by the pilot.

(4) Forgetfulness:
It was the final link in the chain of events. It was primarily triggered by high levels of anxiety, increased workload, and cabin discoordination.

(5) Poor Planning:
The crew did not plan for the execution of a nighttime visual approach and was therefore unprepared to carry it out.

(6) Poor Judgment:
There was a failure in the pilot's judgment during the operation. Initially, there were conditions that did not allow for the continuation of the landing, yet it was proceeded with. Finally, the nighttime visual approach was entirely unfavorable, and nonetheless, it was attempted.

As the airplane was climbing through 15800 feet the flight attendant asked the crew whether they could climb faster to the cruising altitude as she wanted to start cabin service. The pitch attitude was then changed from 3.2 deg to 5.2 deg within 18 seconds. The rate of climb increased from 420 fpm to 900 fpm, but the airspeed had dropped from 173 KIAS to 166 KIAS while climbing through 16100 feet. The pitch angle increased further to 6.4 deg and the airspeed decreased further to 160 knots and later to 141 KIAS. The Brasilia was climbing through FL170 (at 15:33) when the auto flight system disconnected and the stick shaker activated followed by an aural stall warning. The airplane had roll oscillations as high as 90 deg in each direction and pitch attitudes as low as 67 deg nose down. The speed increased to 210 KIAS as the plane descended with 17000 fpm. Control was regained at 5500 feet and an emergency was declared to Memphis ARTCC. A diversion was made to Pine Bluff but the plane overshot the right turn to final for runway 17 due to control problems and the aircraft touched down with 1880 feet of runway remaining. The plane hydroplaned off the runway onto wet rough sod and came to rest 687 feet past the runway end on a heading of 220 deg.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captain's failure to maintain professional cockpit discipline, his consequent inattention to flight instruments and ice accretion, and his selection of an improper auto flight vertical mode, all of which led to an aerodynamic stall, loss of control, and a forced landing. Factors contributing to the accident were poor crew discipline, including flight crew coordination before the stall and the flight crew's inappropriate actions to recover from the loss of control. Also contributing to the accident was fatigue induced by the flight crew's failure to properly manage provided rest periods.""

AF302 had just arrived from Paris and during taxiing, after leaving the runway through the last intersection (taxiway C), the right wing of aircraft collided with the empennage of PT-OQI, which was parked on the taxiway leading to box 1 of the aerodrome's maneuvering yard.
The collision resulted in damage to both aircraft, as well as blocking part of the taxiway M for fifteen minutes.

PT-OQI suffered serious damage. The vertical empennage was twisted, causing damage to the stringers, cladding, ribs and fairings. The steering rudders I and II, tail cone, depth and the intrados lining of the horizontal stabilizer were also damaged. F-GLZB suffered a 20cm cut and 5cm dent on leading edge No. 6 and six dents on leading edge No. 7.

Contributing Factors
Operational Factor
(1) Deficient supervision - contributed
Due to the organizational structure at the time of the accident, in which the same individual accumulated the function of Operations and Maintenance Manager of both Recife Airport Administration and Infraero Regional Superintendence, the planning and management work of the aerodrome was not carried out by an exclusive administrator, in charge of visualizing the particular needs required by each function. Thus, the SBRF aerodrome did not suffer from an effective and adequate supervision of the apron operations, exposing the operations to uncertainties that may arise during the day-to-day operations.
(2) Poor infrastructure - contributed
The procedure of using a single box for the accommodation of two aircraft was adopted without any additional operational measures having been taken to eliminate or at least minimize the possibilities of conflict arising from this improvisation.

The commuter airplane was substantially damaged. There were no injuries to the three crewmembers or to the three passengers. The flight was destined for Palm Springs, California. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
The ramp area lease holder is United Airlines. United Airlines allocates space to United Express to operate a Commuter Air Terminal and park their aircraft. According to agreements with the airport authorities, movement of aircraft within the leasehold is the responsibility of the operator and is done without air traffic control clearance or guidance.
A taxiway was designated by the lease holder for the movement of United Express aircraft to the edge of the ramp area at taxiway 27K and taxiway 19K. The leasehold taxiway provided clearance for United Express aircraft while gaining access to airport taxiways and runways. The taxiway was marked with yellow centerline and taxiway edge stripping. The width of the taxiway was sufficient for a towed Boeing 737 aircraft to clear other aircraft parked in designated numbered spots.

The captain of the Embraer EMB-120RT elected to taxi in a non-movement area and did not use the designated taxiway. The United Express captain said her decision was based on avoiding a delay as a result of encountering a possible conflict with any aircraft being towed for maintenance while gaining access at taxiway 19K.
A construction project had closed the taxiway 27K, which was normally used to exit the ramp. The captain planned to use taxiway 23K further to the east by taxiing behind a row of Boeing 737 aircraft.
The captain was taxing behind the row of parked Boeing 737 aircraft, between the row and an airport access road. A Boeing 767 was parked at the east end of the row near the area where the taxiway joins the ramp. The captain indicated the Embraer's right wing was close to the access road. After the nose of the Embraer cleared the tail of the Boeing 767, the captain turned left towards the Boeing 767 and away from the access road. The left horizontal stabilizer of the Embraer then collided with the bottom of the right elevator on the Boeing 767, twisting the vertical stabilizer on the Embraer about 30 degrees counterclockwise.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captain's decision to taxi across a non-movement aircraft parking area instead of using the designated taxi lane to exit the ramp. A factor in the accident was the dark night environmental lighting conditions.""

At 12:42 the flight was cleared to climb to FL240.
When climbing through FL181, at a speed of 160 knots, the no. 1 engine torque fell from 63% to 0% and a loud thud was heard. The Brasilia rolled left, pitched down and started to descend. With a loud bang, one of the four blades (Hamilton Standard 14RF-9) had separated. The prop couldn't be feathered and an emergency was declared. The aircraft descended at a rate of 1000-2000 ft/min. The Brasilia appeared to be too difficult to control to reach Atlanta. ATC provided flight 529 with vectors to West Georgia Regional Airport. At 12:53 the airspeed steadily decreased from 168 knots to 120 knots IAS. One minute later, the aircraft contacted trees in a 20 degree nose-down attitude and an increasing left-wing-down attitude of 15-40deg. The Embraer flew another 360 feet before crashing into a field.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The in-flight fatigue fracture and separation of a propeller blade resulting in distortion of the left engine nacelle, causing excessive drag, loss of wing lift, and reduced directional control of the airplane. The fracture was caused by a fatigue crack from multiple corrosion pits that were not discovered by Hamilton Standard because of inadequate and ineffective corporate inspection and repair techniques, training, documentation and communication.
Contributing to the accident was Hamilton Standard's and FAA's failure to require recurrent on-wing ultrasonic inspections for the affected propellers. Contributing to the severity of the accident was the overcast cloud ceiling at the accident site.""

The hydraulic system was deenergized and an uneventful landing was made at the departure airport. A postincident examination of the airplane's rudder control system did not reveal any discrepancies. However, hydraulic system fluid samples were obtained and analyzed, along with an inspection, testing, and disassembly of the rudder hydraulic power control unit and the rudder actuators. As a result of the testing, contamination was found in the fluid samples from the airplane's hydraulic reservoirs and the power control unit that exceeded the maximum levels established by the airplane manufacturer's maintenance manual. The operator's FAA accepted general operating manual requires compliance with the manufacturer's maintenance manual. Additionally, the operator did not have an established procedure for periodically sampling and analyzing hydraulic fluid from airplane systems.

Probable Cause: The operator's inadequate progressive inspection program that did not require periodic analysis of airplane hydraulic system fluid; and the failure of the operator to comply with the airplane manufacturer's maintenance manual resulting in contamination of the airplane's hydraulic system that exceeded the maximum contamination level.

The flightcrew completed emergency procedures with negative results, and an emergency landing was made.
The pilot-in-command stated on descent into the Orlando area the hydraulic master caution warning light illuminated, followed by the low level advisory light on the green hydraulic system. He instructed the first officer to review the loss of hydraulic pressure procedure in the quick reference handbook. The hydraulic master caution warning light illuminated again, followed by the low pressure advisory light on the green hydraulic system. The fluid level was pointing to the yellow, the hydraulic pressure was decreasing, and the light for the green system was flashing on and off. The flightcrew concluded that the green hydraulic system was empty and the green electric hydraulic pump was turned off. They discussed what systems would be lost in the event of a total failure of the green hydraulic system, and decided to lower the flaps and landing gear. The flaps were extended to 15 degrees; however the landing gear would not extend. They informed ATC of situation, and were placed in a box pattern east of Orlando International Airport. They performed the abnormal emergency landing gear instructions in the checklist and contacted the Comair maintenance facility for further instructions. Repeated attempts to lower the landing gear were unsuccessful, and a gear up landing was performed.

The aircraft manufacture's inadequate written procedures in the airplane flight manual/quick reference handbook, which resulted in a failure of the landing gear to extend and a wheels up emergency landing, due to hydraulic blockage in the landing gear solenoid valve. Factors relating to the accident were: the chafed and ruptured hydraulic line and the subsequent hydraulic leak, which resulted in loss of hydraulic pressure and an inoperative normal landing gear extension system.

Thirty-eight seconds before impact the aircraft was flying at 4000 feet with a speed of 164 knots, flaps and gear retracted and engines at flight idle. After making a turn to a 090deg. heading, the Brasilia then started a slight roll to the left. When the angle was about 20deg. left wing down, the crew tried to counteract the roll (t-33 sec). The bank angle increased through 30deg. at t-29 sec, followed by an increase in engine power when the crew tried to stop the pitch from decreasing at t-26 sec. At t-17 sec airspeed had dropped to 145 knots when a rapid roll from 40deg. to 146deg. left bank was experienced. At t-10 sec the pitch decreased from 3deg. nose-up to 50deg. nose-down. The aircraft descended out of control, experiencing some steep roll and pitch oscillations and crashed nose down into a snowy field 18 miles short of the Detroit-Metropolitan Airport runway 03. There were indications that the pilots had tried to activate the engine-fire extinguishing system, though no traces of fire on the no. 2 engine have been found by the NTSB.

PROBABLE CAUSE: The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the FAA's failure to establish adequate aircraft certification standards for flight in icing conditions, the FAA's failure to ensure that an FAA/CTA-approved procedure for the accident airplane's deice system operation was implemented by U.S.-based air carriers, and the FAA's failure to require the establishment of adequate minimum airspeeds for icing conditions, which led to the loss of control when the airplane accumulated a thin, rough accretion of ice on its lifting surfaces.
Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's decision to operate in icing conditions near the lower margin of the operating airspeed envelope (with flaps retracted), and Comair's failure to establish and adequately disseminate unambiguous minimum airspeed values for flap configurations and for flight in icing conditions.""

The captain was an instructor, the copilot was receiving line training. The copilot was Pilot Flying (PF). While approaching Vilhena, the weather was reported below minima. Instead of diverting to the alternate airport, the captain decided they should execute an Echo 1 arrival procedure, which was an NDB approach to runway 03. Because actual weather at Vilhena had differed from reported weather conditions in the past, they would descend to MDA. If the runway was not in sight at that point, the approach would be aborted. The copilot inserted an MDA of 2500 feet in the Altitude Alert System. This was an error since the MDA was actually 2560 feet. Both pilot did not notice the error. The instructor told the copilot to monitor the artificial horizon during the final stages of the approach. The copilot focused on the artificial horizon and did not monitor the altimeter. The captain tried to obtain visual contact with the ground, but the city lights were off due to lack of electric energy. He did not call out the altitudes and the airplane did not level off at 2500 feet. The copilot probably shut off or silenced the Altitude Alert System and the airplane continued to descend below MDA. The airplane collided with various trees located to the right and one kilometre short of runway 03. It collided with the ground and skidded to a stop. A fire erupted in the no. 1 engine, spreading to the rest of the airplane. All occupants managed to escape.

The airplane sustained substantial damage. The 2 pilots, 1 flight attendant, and 14 passengers were not injured.
According to the pilots, about 2,000 feet mean sea level (msl) during the initial climb, a bang sound was heard; the airplane yawed right, and the right propeller auto feathered. Flames were observed by passengers and the cabin attendant emanating from the right engine. The crew performed the engine shutdown and fire check lists, and turned off the fuel within 1 minute of the mishap.
The cockpit crew extinguished the fire using both of the airplane's fire bottles. The cockpit crew then observed that hydraulic and rudder lights on the master alert panel were illuminated, along with the associated hydraulic lights on the overhead panel, which indicated loss of both hydraulic systems.
The crew diverted to Naval Air Station (NAS) Miramar, extended the landing gear manually, and accomplished a landing without flaps. The captain indicated that he landed within the first 2,000 feet of runway 24R. He was unable to use single engine reverse thrust to decelerate because of the loss of nose wheel steering. Additionally, the captain attempted to use the airplane's primary and emergency brakes; however, hydraulic pressure was also lost to these systems. The airplane overran the departure end of the runway and came to rest in the adjacent field.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The failure of maintenance personnel to allow adequate time for the engine oil to drain back into the engine oil reservoir prior to adding additional oil, thereby overfilling the reservoir, which resulted in an engine fire and subsequent damage to hydraulic lines and components, including the brakes, which precluded stopping the airplane prior to overrunning the runway end. An additional factor was the confusing and insufficiently defined procedures for servicing the engine oil.""

21 Oct 1998,Embraer EMB-120RT Brasilia,PT-WKH,Capital Táxi Aéreo,3+1,"ca 2 km from Fortaleza-Pinto Martins Airport, CE (FOR)",w/o,https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/323871,EMB-120 Brasilia,E120,08:51,120076,Pratt & Whitney Canada PW118,Fatalities: 3 / Occupants: 3,1,Accident,Approach,Cargo,"Teresina-Senador PetrÃ´nio Portela Airport, PI (THE/SBTE)","Fortaleza-Pinto Martins Airport, CE (FOR/SBFZ)","The Emb-120 carried 2.5 tons of medicines from Teresina to Fortaleza. During the descent for Fortaleza, the crew requested a visual approach with right base leg runway 13. The approach was flown at high speed. Flaps and land gear were selected at a higher speed than authorized. The unstabilized approach was not abandoned and the copilot, who was pilot non flying, did not intervene. On finals the thrust levers were positioned below the flight idle position. The airplane entered an uncontrolled right hand turn, ripped through electrical cables and tore across several rooftops before smashing into a brick house, killing a woman inside. Seven other people were injured in either the resulting fires or by flying debris.

CONCLUSION:
Human Factor - Psychological Aspect - Contributed.
In the individual aspect, there were signs of concern of the crew member with prolonged waiting caused by the local traffic in Fortaleza and by another traffic that was approaching the aerodrome and, because of this, accelerated the procedure of the final approach, descending at high speed and triggering the other operational failures that led to the accident; in the same way, there were signs of excessive self-confidence by the pilot.

Operational Factor
(1). Deficient Maintenance - Indetermined.
The operator's delay in submitting the requested documentation for the aircraft reduced the credibility of the submitted material. The possibility that the secondary stop was deactivated, despite statements to the contrary by a mechanic, would have been caused by inadequate participation of maintenance personnel in the services performed and by non-compliance with the planned AD.
(2). Deficient Supervision - Indeterminate.
There are reports from several pilots about this commander's habits of performing unforeseen procedures, including some that avoided flying with him. It was not researched if the other crew members took this fact to the company's management. The company's response was not researched if it was aware of these operational deviations.
(3). Deficient Cabin Coordination - Contributed.
The pilot misused the resources available in the operation of the aircraft, due to ineffective management of the tasks related to the PF and PNF and the noncompliance with operational rules.
The PNF did not advise the PF during the approach. The PNF accepted the non-stabilized approach and did not react to reverse the situation.
(4). Deficient Judgement - Contributed.
The crew made the approach above the glide slope and at high speed; thought inappropriately that it could proceed in those conditions and that there would be ways to reduce the speed and make the landing.
(5). Flight Indiscipline - Contributed.
The crew disobeyed the aircraft's operating rules by performing a destabilized approach outside the envelope recommended by the manufacturer and by placing the power levers below the flight idle position.

The strip then bounced off the tarmac under the aircraft and struck the right propeller blades. The engines were shutdown and all passengers disembarked safely.

The propeller blades had completed a total of 17,161 hours in service. The last repair work including the fitment of the nickel sheath protective strips took place approximately 2,100 hours prior to the incident.

The erosion strip was recovered and was forwarded for specialist metallurgical examination. This examination confirmed that the erosion strip had separated due to loss of adhesion at the adhesive to sheath interface.

The propeller blade and the failed portions of the nickel sheath were returned to the manufactuer for detailed examination including investigation of the procedures used to perform the nickel sheath replacement. It was found that the sheath had been bonded using an approved adhesive AF111. Inspection of the nickel sheath showed that the surface had been prepared correctly prior to the adhesive being applied. Examination of the blade and nickel sheath showed the cause of the separation to be cracking of the sheath-to-blade bond joint. Spectrum analysis of the adhesive showed the presence of silicone.

The investigation determined that this contamination was introduced during the bonding process. Review of the process showed that an adhesive tape containing silicone had been used, and this is considered to be the most likely cause of the introduction of silicone.

The propeller manufacturer has reviewed its procedures associated with this process. Improvements have been identified, and are being incorporated into the manufacturer's Component Maintenance Manuals."

Just prior to top-of-descent, the crew reported that they heard a loud bang from the right side of the aircraft, and the aircraft simultaneously yawed to the right. Suspecting an engine failure, the pilot-in-command disconnected the autopilot and re-trimmed the aircraft, noting that a considerable amount of rudder trim was required to maintain directional control.
Observation of the engine instruments by the crew confirmed a right engine failure, with the right engine torque gauge indicating 1%. A burning smell and fine smoke then became evident in the cockpit, and the crew put on their oxygen masks. Communications between the two pilots proved difficult with the masks fitted, due to a faulty right oxygen mask microphone. The crew positioned the right engine power lever to flight idle and commenced a descent. The flight attendant also indicated to the crew that smoke had begun to enter the cabin area.
The smoke immediately began to dissipate, following the reduction in engine power. The crew then shut down the right engine in accordance with company operating procedures, and broadcast to Air Traffic Control requesting that emergency services be made available on arrival at Tindal. Air Traffic Control declared a distress phase.
The crew removed their oxygen masks as the smoke had dissipated from the cockpit, however, they still fitted the masks intermittently due to the residual strong burning smell.
By that time the flight attendant had completed the company emergency plan actions, and following approval from the pilots, conducted the emergency briefing. During the briefing, some of the passengers indicated that they were experiencing difficulty hearing the details of the pre-recorded instructions, and the flight attendant had to stop the presentation several times to repeat unheard information. After the flight attendant's briefing, the pilot in command used the public address system to inform the passengers of the right engine problem.
After the single-engine landing, the crew stopped the aircraft on the runway. Emergency services indicated that there was a fuel leak from the right engine cowling. As a precaution, the crew shut down the left engine and instructed the flight attendant to disembark the passengers onto the runway through the main cabin entrance door.
The operator conducted an initial inspection of the failed Pratt and Whitney PW118A engine. This inspection revealed extensive damage to the engine's power turbine and a jammed low-pressure compressor. The reduction gearbox also appeared to have decoupled from the engine, with internal damage to the reduction gearbox case. The engine oil filter bypass indicator had activated, with evidence of metal contamination in the oil filter and on the reduction gearbox chip detector.
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) then quarantined the engine, and delivered it to Pratt and Whitney Canada (PWC) for an investigation supervised by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. The PWC investigation found that the in-flight shut down had occurred due to the decoupling of the reduction gearbox drive from the power turbine rotor. This was considered to be a direct result of the fracture of the reduction gearbox input shaft by torsional overload."

During the initial descent from 22,000 feet mean sea level (msl) to 14,000 feet msl, the trim wheel moved to the forward stop. The trim wheel made a ""snapping"" motion midway through the movement, and then moved aft. The trim wheel continued to move back and forth, so the crew disconnected the autopilot and trim. The airplane wanted to pitch up, and the captain had to apply moderate forward pressure to maintain pitch control. The trim wheel was still jammed, but one crewmember could control the airplane. At 12,000 feet msl, and approximately 23 degrees Fahrenheit outside air temperature, the trim remained immovable. Between 5,000 feet msl and 4,000 feet msl, the trim wheel became moveable. By the time the airplane reached the traffic pattern altitude, the trim wheel moved freely. The outside temperature at that time was 46 degrees Fahrenheit. Examination of the elevator trim units revealed that one trim actuator had leaking shaft seals. Its packing had cracked, and a bearing had seized. The second actuator was dirty, and minor corrosion was on the hardware. The shaft seals leaked, and a rigging device was installed. Service Difficulty Report (SDR) data from August 30, 1990, to February 29, 2000, contained 19 reports of the elevator trim freezing at altitude. Nine of the reports noted that the trim operated normally after descent to lower altitudes and warmer temperatures. Eleven additional reports referenced binding or stiffness at altitude. Some of the airplanes experienced multiple events. During some of the events, the airplane pitched violently. The manufacturer discovered moisture and corrosion in some of the actuators that were submitted for repair after these occurrences. They suspected that leaking seals allowed moisture into the actuators, which froze at altitude. They developed a modification that included installation of additional seals inside the actuator. However, Skywest maintenance records indicate that both unmodified (Part Number 5299) and modified (Part Number 5299-1) actuators experienced problems. Both actuators on the incident airplane were unmodified units. Total time on the airplane was 3,757 hours.

Probable Cause: Moisture contamination of the elevator trim actuator units resulting in their failure to operate at below freezing temperatures

Simultaneously, the captain and first officer applied forward pressure on their control columns to regain control of the airplane. The airplane was re-established in a descent and the flight crew found that the airplane was controllable in the landing configuration. Subsequently, the flight landed without further incident. Post incident examination of the airplane revealed that the right elevator trim control wheel was improperly installed. The installation allowed the autopilot trim servo to request nose down trim until the trim tab actuators had reached their physical limits. The autopilot trim servo continued to request nose down trim, loading the elevator trim system cables, until the autopilot disconnected. During the examination, it was also noted that the trim tab deflections and cable tensions did not meet manufacturer specifications. Review of maintenance records revealed two instances when the elevator pitch trim system underwent maintenance. On April 14, 1998, the right side elevator trim control wheel was removed and reinstalled ""while aligning stop arm into wheel."" Continental Express reported that the trim tabs were adjusted during the maintenance. On August 11, 2000, the following maintenance write-up was recorded in the aircraft flight log: ""Elev trim will not go full forward, stops at two units."" The flight log indicated that the following corrective action was taken; ""Lubed trim wheel for elev trim."" Continental Express reported that the trim wheel was not removed during this corrective action.

Probable Cause: the improper installation of the right elevator trim control wheel by company mechanics, which resulted in an elevator trim malfunction.

The 3-person crew and 15 passengers were uninjured, and 1 passenger received serious injuries. The accident occurred at night, during visual meteorological conditions.
According to the captain, within seconds of landing on runway 23, the airplane struck two deer. The flight attendant then contacted the cockpit crew, and informed them that there was an injured passenger. After parking at the gate, a walk-around inspection revealed that the tip of a propeller blade from the number 2 engine had separated, and punctured the airplane's fuselage.
Weather at the time of the accident included overcast skies and light snow.
One of the deer was hit by the nose landing gear and the other was hit by the right engine propeller. The separated blade tip was about 4 inches long and 3 inches wide. It entered the cabin just aft of frame 21, between stringers 14R and 15R. The passenger was sitting in seat 3C.

An airport inspection following the accident revealed breaches in the perimeter fence, in gully areas near the approach end of runway 15, and abeam runway 23, about 1,300 feet from the runway threshold.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Deer on the runway. Factors included reduced visibility due to nighttime lighting and light snow conditions, breaches in the perimeter fence, increased seasonal deer activity, and the rural location of the airport.""

They indicated that these actions were unsuccessful and the speed further deteriorated to about 130 knots at which point the airplane rolled about 90 degrees to the left, and then back to near level. In the next 24 seconds, the airplane again rolled about 110 degrees to the left, back to level, then about 120 degrees to the right, back to level, and then rolled 360 degrees to the right, back to near wings level. Since the crew reported trouble with the flight attitude instruments, the roll angles recorded on the FDR are being further investigated. The maximum nose down pitch attitude was 60 degrees, the maximum recorded airspeed was about 240 kias, and maximum vertical acceleration during recovery was about +3.6 g. The crew immediately diverted to West Palm Beach and landed there 12 minutes after the upset.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The failure of the flight crew to maintain airspeed during an encounter with severe icing conditions, which resulted in an inadvertent stall, loss of control, and structural damage to the airplane.""

The aircraft climbed to its assigned cruising altitude of FL220, which was reached at 06:53. Permission to descend was given at 07:12 and at 07:23 the crew started an ILS approach to runway 30. Two minutes later the captain experienced control problems, which he attributed to an autopilot malfunction. An increase in the rate of descent went unnoticed by the crew who tried to find out the cause of the control problems. As the plane was descending over mountainous terrain, the GPWS alarm sounded three times. The approach controller then asked if the flight was established on the localizer and ILS glidepath. The copilot then replied that they had captured the localizer. Approach Control then instructed the crew to contact Bilbao Tower. Contact was not established however. The copilot noticed that they had not captured the glidepath and informed the captain. The airplaneÂ´s speed and rate of descent were reduced and a smooth climb was initiated. Six seconds later the airplane flew into the side of the Monte de Santa Marina, some 18 nm (33 km) from Bilbao Airport. The mountain has an altitude of 675 m (2215 ft).

CAUSAS: ""El accidente se produjo por no mantener la aeronave una separaciÃ³n adecuada con el terreno cuando se realizaba la maniobra de aproximaciÃ³n al aeropuerto de destino, como consecuencia de haber focalizado la tripulaciÃ³n su atenciÃ³n en la desconexiÃ³n del piloto automÃ¡tico .

The flight crew feathered the propellers and applied the brakes as they wanted to stop the aircraft. There was no deceleration after both captain and co-pilot used the brakes. The co-pilot suggested to use reverse thrust, but the propellers were already feathered.
In an attempt to avoid impact against a building ahead, the pilot turned the aircraft to the left. The emergency brake was applied; however, by that time the aircraft collided with another brick building. On impact, the left propeller and engine were damage, and the right landing gear fell into a drainage ditch, approximately one meter deep.
All occupants were unhurt.

1 Human Factor
Operational Aspect
a. Training - Contributed
The crew did not have sufficient training to enable the desired assertiveness for the correct use of aircraft resources, which would probably have prevented the accident, since, instead of applying the emergency brake, they applied reverse with the feathered props, contrary to the procedure provided for in the Aircraft Manual.
b. Maintenance - Contributed
The maintenance services were not efficient, as they did not comply with the Aircraft Maintenance Manual in relation to the dimensional adjustment of the Hub Cap Drive Clips' drive clips, and the Service Bulletin incorporated stickers to the outer doors of the main landing gear, as a reminder to the mechanic to check the clearances.
c. Application of the Commands - Contributed
The co-pilot failed to apply the reverse pitch on the propellers as they were feathered, and at that moment the emergency brake should be commanded to brake the aircraft.
d. Supervision - Contributed
The company failed to adequately check the execution of the actions provided for in the Aircraft Maintenance Manual regarding the ""Anti-Skid"" system and to verify the application of all service bulletins issued by the manufacturer.

Following de-icing, the crew taxied the airplane from the ramp to the runway and began their takeoff roll. The captain said that everything was fine initially. When the airplane passed the 7,000 foot remaining marker, it began tracking left. The captain said he tried to correct the situation with rudder and differential power, but the airplane continued to track left. The captain said, ""I lost control of the situation when the left mains got into the soft earth at the edge of the runway.""

The airport manager reported that at the time of the incident, the runway was covered with 1 to 1-1/2 inches of snow and slush. An examination of the airplane's tire tracks in the snow showed the airplane began its takeoff roll to the left of the runway centerline. The tracks proceeded further left of centerline as they proceeded down the runway until they were off the left side of the runway. An examination of the airplane revealed no anomalies.

The airplane was on a domestic flight from SÃ£o Paulo de OlivenÃ§a to Manaus via TefÃ©. While 20 nm out of Manaus, air traffic control instructed the pilot to leave the landing pattern to the left in order to give priority to a medical aircraft. The airplane proceeded under radar vectoring and confirmed it had reached 2,000 feet at 18:34. This was the last contact with the flight. The wreckage of the airplane was located at 18:50 about 18 nm from the airport, in a heavily forested area. There were no survivors.

Contributing Factors
a. Human Factor
(1) Physiological â€“ Did not contribute.
(2) Psychological â€“ Contributed.
The accident occurred within the realm of individual psychological aspects and psychosocial variables which, once integrated, indicate a chain of previous events leading to dangerous situations and actions that facilitate the breakdown of routines and doctrines inherent in the prevention of aviation accidents.
The human factor was present in the modules of doctrine and standardization, deviation from operational procedures, training and application of knowledge, situational awareness, and prompt response, with variations in motivational, situational, decision-making, and perceptual domains, as well as characteristics related to the personalities of the crew members that influenced the non-conservative attitudes present during the flight. The timing for action was impaired by attention away from the focus, poor communication, ambiguous perception, or failure in the perception of occurrences in the cockpit, and lack of attention in the approach procedure for landing the equipment.

b. Material Factor
Did not contribute.

c. Operational Factor
(1) Inadequate Instruction â€“ Contributed
The Training Program was not followed, as the simulator training sessions and LOFT training were not carried out, nor was the CRM course for the crew members renewed. The non-use of these tools greatly degraded the dynamics of the crew and allowed the low situational awareness displayed.
(2) Inadequate Maintenance - Undetermined
Although no abnormalities in the operation of the autopilot were identified in the crew's comments, it cannot be ruled out that some malfunction occurred, as had happened on previous flights, due to deficiencies in maintenance services, causing the aircraft to descend below the expected altitude.
(3) Inadequate Application of Controls - Undetermined
There is a possibility that the crew did not operate the aircraft's autopilot properly. If such action was carried out, it was not perceived by the crew members, with the deficiency linked to aspects related to training and situational awareness.
(4) Inadequate Air Traffic Control â€“ Undetermined
When comparing the message to maintain 2000 ft, the crew generated certainty in the controller about the receipt and compliance of that directive, allowing him to turn his attention to the aircraft carrying the sick person. Thus, it cannot be asserted that such a situation contributed to the accident due to the practically uniform characteristics of the descent profile that the aircraft had been developing until the moment of impact, thus making the participation of this aspect in the accident indeterminate.
(5) Inadequate Cockpit Coordination - Contributed
The management of activities inherent to the phases of descent and approach did not follow the standardized form established by the MGO. The lack of a descent briefing, the non-performance of the planned call-outs, the incomplete verification of authorizations from air traffic control bodies, the undefined tasks during the descent, and the lack of comments pertinent to alarms allowed the lowering of the crew's situational awareness.
(6) Inadequate Planning â€“ Contributed
The pilots did not perform a descent briefing nor any preparation for the approach and landing to be carried out, allowing inattention to authorized critical altitudes and the non-performance of the planned call-outs.
(7) Inadequate Supervision - Contributed
Contributions from deficiencies related to supervision in various sectors of the company were verified, which negatively influenced the operational aspects now addressed.
The inadequate dissemination and maintenance of an operational culture in line with the principles of Flight Safety contributed to the low situational awareness of the crew - evidenced in the accident - influenced by various aspects within the structure of the company.
The non-compliance with the activities planned regarding training and operational performance indicates a lack of adequate supervision in the planning and execution of the Company's operations.
(8) Other Operational Aspects - Contributed
As an extension of Inadequate Supervision as a Contributing Factor, it was necessary to characterize the non-performance of actions foreseen in the Company's Aeronautical Accident Prevention Program - PPAA.
The application of the planned Flight Safety Inspection program would increase the possibility of identifying and addressing discrepancies and deficiencies existing in the company, including those related to the training of the crew members.

The crew was being radar vectored for a localiser/DME approach to Runway 08 at Ronaldsway, Isle of Man. The crew had mistakenly set the IOM VOR instead of the appropriate ILS although the commander stated he was later aware of this, prior to the aircraft commencing its descent. He believed it would make a good training point and so did not point out the mistake to the first officer and left the VOR selected. As a result the aircraft descended by reference to the wrong DME some 5nm early, descending to 475 feet over the sea more than 5nm short of the runway. The crewâ€™s actions were questioned by ATC and the commander immediately climbed the aircraft back to 1,600 feet to re-establish on the correct approach path before landing.

While passing through 400 ft above ground level on final approach to Jundee Airstrip, with flaps 45 set, the aircraft drifted left of the runway centreline. When a go-around was initiated, the aircraft aggressively rolled and yawed left, causing the crew control difficulties. The crew did not immediately complete the go-around procedures. Normal aircraft control was regained when the landing gear was retracted about 3 minutes later.
The left engine had sustained a total power loss following fuel starvation, because the left fuel tank was empty.

Contributing safety factors:
â€¢ Regulatory guidance regarding the measurement of fuel quantity before flight lacked clarity and appropriate emphasis and did not ensure that the fuel quantity measurement procedures used by operators included two totally independent methods. [Safety issue]
â€¢ The practices used by the operatorâ€™s pilots for measuring and logging of fuel quantity were inconsistent. [Safety issue]
â€¢ Faults within the fuel quantity indicating system caused the left fuel quantity indicator to over-read.
â€¢ The left engine lost power when the fuel in the left tank was exhausted.
â€¢ The flight crew did not detect the engine power loss.
â€¢ The aircraft became misaligned with the runway.
â€¢ The flight crew did not complete the go-around procedure actions.
â€¢ There was a significant delay before the crew configured the aircraft appropriately for one-engine inoperative flight.
â€¢ The absence of simulator training meant that the endorsement and other training the flight crew had undergone did not adequately prepare them for the event. [Safety issue]
â€¢ There was no regulatory requirement for simulator training in Australia. [Safety issue]

The aircraft was lined up with the left edge of the runway. Shortly after the take-off roll commenced, the crew reported feeling two or three bumps on the runway, after which time the crew's attention was drawn to an electrical burning smell in the cockpit, followed by a high-speed warning. The smell dispersed and the flight continued as normal to Melbourne.
Pre-flight checks for the return flight to Sydney revealed damage to the aircraft, which was subsequently found to have been caused by impact with the runway edge lighting on the left side of Sydney runway 16R, where the aircraft had started its take-off run. The aircraft was grounded at Melbourne for repair.

Contributing safety factors:
- The taxiway B4 left edge marking led onto taxiway B5, instead of runway 16R.
- Neither of the flight crew noticed the aircraft was not aligned with the runway centreline prior to commencing the take-off roll.
- An additional area of tarmac adjacent to the runway between taxiways B4 and B5, combined with reduced visual cues associated with night operations, probably created the impression that the aircraft had proceeded further into the runway than it actually had.

He reported that he never saw the jet bridge on the left side. He turned his attention back to the marshaller and saw his arms moving up indicating they were close to stopping. Before the marshaller crossed his day wands to indicate the stop location, the first officer felt something hit the airplane.
The marshaller reported that he was concentrating on the airplane's right side where a fuel truck was parked close to the envelope line and was concerned about the truck's proximity to the airplane. Because of where his attention was focused, he misjudged the stop line marked for EMB airplanes and instead signaled the airplane to stop on the line marked for CRJ airplanes. Just as he crossed his wands, the left engine propeller struck the jet bridge.
Postaccident examination of the airplane and surrounding parking area revealed that the airplane's nosewheel tire came to rest about 18 feet beyond the stop line marked 'EMB,Ã¢Â€Â at a line marked 'RJ50.Ã¢Â€Â
A reenactment of the incident, accomplished by towing an airplane on the taxi line toward the RJ50 stop line, determined that the flight crew had a clear view of the surroundings associated with the gate, including the jet bridge, when both occupants turned to look out the left cockpit window. In addition, it was also determined that the captain would be able to see part of the left engine and propeller as the airplane approached the jet bridge just prior to the RJ50 stop line.

Probable Cause: The flight crew's failure to maintain clearance from the jet bridge during taxi. Contributing to the incident was the ramp marshaller's diverted attention and failure to signal the flight crew to stop at the correct position.

Both pilots were killed.
The EMB-120 prepared to take off from the taxiway E2 intersection of runway 29. The flight was a training flight to revalidate the captain's command instrument rating. The supervisory pilot/training captain advised the aerodrome controller that the departure would incorporate asymmetric flight (a simulated engine failure), and was approved by the controller to perform the manoeuvre.
Witnesses reported that the takeoff appeared 'normal' until a few moments after becoming airborne, when the aircraft rolled and diverged left from its takeoff path. They watched as the aircraft continued rolling left, and entered a steep nose-down attitude. The airplane impacted the ground in a right wing-low, nose-down attitude of about 65 degrees. A high intensity, fuel-fed fire that followed the collision with the ground destroyed most of the fuselage and cabin and right wing.

CONTRIBUTING SAFETY FACTORS:
- The pilot in command initiated a simulated left engine failure just after becoming airborne and at a speed that did not allow adequate margin for error.
- The pilot in command simulated a failure of the left engine by selecting flight idle instead of zero thrust, thereby simulating a simultaneous failure of the left engine and its propeller autofeather system, instead of a failure of the engine alone.
- The pilot under check operated the aircraft at a speed and attitude (bank angle) that when uncorrected, resulted in a loss of control.
- The pilot under check increased his workload by increasing torque on the right engine and selecting the yaw damper.
- The pilot in command probably became preoccupied and did not abandon the simulated engine failure after the heading and speed tolerance for the manoeuvre were exceeded and before control of the aircraft was lost.

There were no injuries to the 2 crewmembers onboard but the airplane sustained substantial damage. The flight was operating under 14 CFR Part 121 Supplemental as a cargo only flight from Anchorage, Alaska (KANC)Â to KILI.

The Captain reported that the flight from KANC had been uneventful.Â  The Captain reported that during the descent, while at about 250 knots airspeed with his hands on the controls and the autopilot engaged, the airplane pitched to about 20 degrees nose down. The captain reported he then disconnected the autopilot and adjusted the pitch trim while pulling back on the column to recover from the pitch excursion. The flight crew declared an emergency andÂ slowed the airplane to about 200 knots.Â  Approximately 5-10 miles from the airport, while in a slow left turn at 3000 feet msl altitude, the airplane pitched down a second time while the captain was hand flying.Â  Â As he recovered from the pitch down, he was lined up for a 5 mile final approach for runway 35. Â The captain elected to make a high speed, flaps up landing and landed uneventfully on runway 35. Post-flight inspection revealed that the left elevator was bent at the mid span trim tab, had partially detached from the aircraft, and was missing two attachment bolts.

A review of the airplane maintenance history showed that while in ""A"" check maintenance, a dent was noted in the left elevator and the elevator was removed.Â  The maintenance team did not follow the EMB 120 maintenance manual procedure for removal of the left elevator.Â  During the non-routine maintenance procedures used by the maintenance team, cotter pin safeties that were removed from castellated nuts on the 2 outboard vertical hinge bolts on the left elevator were not reinstalled.Â The removal of these two bolts is not part of the EMB 120 maintenance manual procedure for removal of the left elevator.Â  The maintenance team did not document the non-routine procedure they used to remove and reinstall the left elevator.

The Require Inspection Items (RII)Â inspector had inspected theÂ elevator installationÂ for the procedures in the manual and was not aware of the undocumented non-routine maintenance procedures used, and hence did not examine the nuts that did not have the required cotter pins, which were not to be removed as part of the approved procedure. The FAA found that the maintenance teams that removed and reinstalled the elevator were inexperienced in EMB 120 elevator removal and reinstallation procedures.

Probable Cause: the maintenance personnel's failure to install the cotter pins that secured castellated nuts on the left elevator vertical hinge bolts, which resulted in the left elevator partially detaching in flight. Contributing to the accident was the failure of maintenance personnel to document the non-routine maintenance procedure that was used to remove and reinstall the elevator during maintenance.

The airplane impacted the ground near the airport fuel depot and broke up. A fire erupted. There were 20 people on board the plane. Seven occupants initially survived the accident. Three later died in hospital.
Associated Aviation flight SCD-361 was on a chartered flight from Lagos to Akure, Nigeria. The airplane was carrying the body of a former Governor of Ondo State, Dr. Olusegun Agagu, for burial in Akure.
At 09:07 hours local time, start-up of the aircraft was granted by the controller. Engine no.2 was started first, followed by engine no.1. At this point, the crew observed that the No. 1 engine torque indicator was stuck at 76% which prompted the Pilot Monitoring (PM) to conduct an Electronic Engine Controls (EEC) test; however, the indicator remained at 76%. The PM invited the engineer who was a crew member, into the cockpit to ascertain the job done on the EEC. The job done could not be determined as the engineer reported he was not part of the team that worked on the aircraft. The engineer then requested that the PM test the EEC, but the PM responded that this had already been done several times previously. Nonetheless, the PM repeated the EEC test.
At 09:20 the PM requested taxi clearance from Lagos Tower. The flight was cleared to taxi to the holding point for runway 18L. During the taxi, the crew continued with further discussions on the state of the aircraft without briefing or referring to any document. Considering that the No. 1 torque indicator remained stuck at 76%, the crew decided to set power using T6.
At 09:26 SCD361 was cleared to Akure on airway A609, climb Flight Level 190, squawk 0504 and to line-up and wait. SCD361 acknowledged. The flight crew agreed to perform a flapless take-off ""again"", if the flap configuration warning came on. At 09:28 the Tower controller re-cleared SCD361 to route via airway R778, Flight Level 190. The crew carried out the ""Cleared into position"" checklist. At about 09:29 flight 361 was cleared for takeoff on runway 18L; wind was calm. Approximately 4 seconds after engine power was advanced to commence the takeoff roll, the crew received an automated aural warning ""Takeoff Flaps.. Takeoff Flaps."" as the flaps had not been set for takeoff. The copilot noted that the aircraft was moving slowly. Four seconds later, the aural warning sounded: ""Takeoff Flaps.. Auto feather."" The flight data recorder shows that at this time the right hand engine appeared to be producing considerably less thrust than the left engine.
The no. 2 prop had feathered and during the takeoff the fire handle for that engine was activated.
Some 12 seconds after announcing the '80 knots' call the first officer asked if the take-off should be aborted. Airspeed at the time would have been about 95 knots. The captain indicated that they should continue. The crew did not make a V1 or Vr call. During the rotation, the first officer stated ""gently"". The First Officer indicated that the aircraft was not climbing and advised the captain who was flying not to stall the aircraft. Immediately after lift-off, the aircraft slowly veered off the runway heading to the right and was not climbing properly. Ten seconds after rotation the stall warning sounded. An aerodynamic stall occurred and the airplane impacted the ground in a nose down near 90 degree right bank attitude.

Causal Factor
i. The decision of the crew to continue the take-off despite the abnormal No. 2 Propeller rpm indication.
ii. Low altitude stall as a result of low thrust at start of roll for take-off from No. 2 Engine caused by an undetermined malfunction of the propeller control unit.
Contributory Factors
i. The aircraft was rotated before attaining V1.
ii. The decision to continue the take-off with flap configuration warning and auto- feather warning at low speed.
iii. Poor professional conduct of the flight crew.
iv. Inadequate application of Crew Resource Management (CRM) principles.
v. Poor company culture.
vi. Inadequate regulatory oversight.

The first officer was Pilot Flying and the captain was Pilot Monitoring. As there is only one steering tiller in this type of aircraft, located on the left hand side of the cockpit, the captain performed taxiing until the aircraft was lined up on the runway, ready for take-off. At that time, the controls were handed over to the first officer. During taxiing, the first officer was responsible for radio communication.
At 18:20 hours local time taxi clearance was obtained and the flight crew was instructed to taxi via taxiway A to taxiway B, using intersection A2 and S7 for take-off from runway 24.
During taxiing on taxiway B the ground controller asked if the flight crew would like an intersection take-off. The flight crew accepted this and the ground controller asked if S4 or S5 would be acceptable. The flight crew preferred S5 and the ground controller subsequently cleared the flight to hold short at S5.
As the aircraft approached S5, the ground controller instructed the flight crew to change radio frequency to the Tower frequency. The Pilot Monitoring contacted the Tower frequency and the runway controller gave take-off clearance for runway 24 with the instruction to stay on the Tower frequency.
The flight crew completed the before take-off checklist and the captain positioned the aircraft on runway 24. Subsequently, the runway controller gave the instruction to make a right-hand turn and steer heading 270 after take-off. The captain handed over the controls to the first officer, who became Pilot Flying. The captain, now the Pilot Monitoring, acknowledged the radio call and read back the tower instructions.
Take-off power was selected by the Pilot Flying and, in effect, the aircraft’s speed increased. During the take-off roll some bumps were felt by the flight crew. According to the flight crew it is not unusual to feel bumps as the nose wheel runs over the runway’s centre line lights. The crew heard a ""thump"" noise as well during the take-off roll. After a brief discussion it was concluded that it might have been a cargo box or the captain’s flight bag that fell to the floor. The take-off roll was continued with all aircraft indications, vibrations and noise being normal.
When the aircraft reached a velocity of 90 knots, the captain made a speed call out which was crosschecked by the first officer. The decision speed (V1 = 112 knots) was called out and, three seconds later, V-rotate (VR = 113 knots) was reached. During rotation, the stall warning light appeared on the Main Annunciator Panel (MAP) and an aural warning sound was activated in the cockpit. The aircraft was pitched down by the Pilot Flying and the take-off was continued.
The aircraft became airborne and a few seconds later the stall warning light disappeared. The flight crew interpreted the warning as false. During the climb the captain took over the flight controls to confirm the aircraft’s controllability after which the controls were handed back to the first officer for the rest of the flight. According to the flight crew all indications, including pressurization and vibrations, were normal during the entire flight.
The aircraft landed at London Stansted Airport on runway 22 after which it taxied to stand 205. The aircraft was parked and the engines were shut down. At the same time, a ground employee alerted the flight crew, by means of hand signals, that the aircraft was damaged. During the walk around, damage to the right-hand fuselage was observed. Also, three propeller blades of the right-hand engine were damaged. A metal wire was found embedded in one of the three damaged propeller blades.
The aircraft was ferried to Madrid on January 22 and was back in service on February 22.

Conclusion by the Dutch Safety Board:
Given the factual information it is concluded that the EMB-120 aeroplane made a misaligned take-off from Runway 24 at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, at night. During take-off, the crew interpreted the right-hand side runway edge lights as the runway centre line lights. Evidently, visual cues provided in the form of taxiway markings and lighting turned out to be insufficient for a correct guidance of the aeroplane from the taxiway to the runway centre line. The large turning angle, required to align the aeroplane with the runway centre line, in combination with the discontinuity of the taxiway S5 centre
line and absence of the taxiway centre line lighting have contributed to the misaligned take-off. In addition, the ATC clearance during the turn from taxiway B onto S5 and Runway 24 might have distracted the flight crew.
During the take-off roll several runway edge lights were struck by the nose landing gear of which the pilots were unaware. It is suspected that, on several occasions, the edge lights were catapulted leading to damage to the aeroplane. Despite the sustained damage, the aeroplane was able to take off and reach its destination airport. No other damage occurred.
The absence of centre line lighting on taxiway S5 is not in correspondence with the specifications set in CS ADR-DSN.M.710.
The absence of a continuous centre line marking on taxiway S5 leading to the centre line of Runway 06/24 is not in correspondence with the specifications set in CS-ADR-DSN.L.555.
This was corrected after the occurrence had taken place.
LVNL was aware of the risks of intersection take-offs before the incident occurred. However, this did not lead to operational measures by LVNL.
Intersection S5 was also a recommended intersection outside the uniform daylight period despite the fact that the intersection did not have centre line lighting.
The LVNL report does not consider the question of whether intersection S5 is justifiably designated as a ‘recommended intersection’ in the Operations Manual and if offering the intersection concerned is a wise choice.
After the decision was taken not to install centre line lights on intersection S5, LVNL retained the qualification of intersection S5 as a ‘recommended intersection’ in the Operations Manual. There was no reconsideration.

The damage was classified as substantial as it would adversely affect the structural strength of the fuselage.
The flight crew reported they picked up four pallets of cargo at John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport (CYHM), Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Â 
Two of the pallets were loaded in zone 2 and two were loaded into zone 3.Â 
The pallets were secured with vertical cargo nets.Â  The flight crew departed CYHM at 1322 UTC and arrived at KSHV at 1657 to clear US customs and to take on fuel.Â  They departed KSHV at 1727 UTC for MMQT. After the accident, the operator reminded flight crews to fly 5 or more miles away from thunderstorm cells identifiedÂ on the weather radar and to secure cargo better to decrease the likelihood that it will shift during turbulence encounters.Â 

Probable Cause: An encounter with severe turbulence, which caused the improperly secured cargo to shift and damage the airplane floor structure.

The aircraft went off the left side of the runway. It came to rest with the left-hand main gear and nose landing gear in a ditch.
Nobody was injured during the incident.

On August 7, 2019, another SARPA aircraft (BAe Jetstream) suffered a runway excursion on landing at BahÃ­a Solano.

Probable cause(s)
Inadequate decision making by the crew when continuing the landing in limited visibility conditions due to the presence of rain, which caused the landing to take place outside the runway.
Contributing Factors
Lack of risk management by the Operator, by not analyzing the weather conditions that may change, and the conditions of the runway at the destination airfield, in order to provide the crew with complete information and facilitate and support decision making for a safe operation.
Deficient conditions at El Refugio de La Macarena aerodrome, with little visible runway demarcation, lack of lighting and weather vane, and poor condition of the safety zone, with puddles, waterlogging and mud that prevented directional control, and a drainage channel that stopped the aircraft in an inclined manner.
Adverse weather conditions at the La Macarena airfield, due to the presence of heavy rain that limited the visibility of the crew to the runway on the final approach.

All six on board were killed.
The aircraft had departed Mogadishu and landed at Baidoa before proceeding to Bardale. On board were a captain, copilot, flight engineer and a trainee pilot, and two people working for the airline, according to Somalia's Transport minister.
Ethiopian troops were stationed both at Baidoa and at Bardale as part of the Africa Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).
In a statement, AMISOM reported that the aircraft was approaching from the west, while the usual landing direction was from the east. Apparently the aircraft then overflew the airfield at a low altitude while going around. A witness reported that there were animals on or near the runway at the time.
Ethiopian soldiers believed it was a suicide plane trying to find a target in the base camp. It was then shot down using a ZU-23 anti-aircraft cannon."

Pori Airport (EFPO) at 07:26 h local time. The flight was the dayâ€™s first sector for the airplane and the crew.
The airplane reached flight level 170 at approximately 07:50 h. It encountered light icing and turbulence at this flight level and therefore the pilots requested descent to flight level 150, which was approved.
The captain retarded both power levers to reduce engine power and begin descent. While monitoring the engine instruments during power lever movement, the captain noted that right engine torque and fuel flow had dropped below their normal values with the torque indicator reading nearly zero and fuel flow reduced from 230 kg/h to 70 kg/h. The captain advanced both power levers to increase right engine power, but the engine did not respond to power lever movements.
The engine did not shut down, but failed to produce power, and slight vibration was felt in the cockpit. The captain and the first officer discussed the matter, concluded that they had an engine malfunction to handle, and carried out the applicable memory items. The captain instructed the first officer to declare emergency.
The first officer transmitted mayday at 07:51 h and informed air traffic control that the flight would continue to Helsinki. At 0755 h, the pilots shut down the affected engine as a precautionary measure in accordance with the QRH procedure. At 07:56 h, they requested descent to a lower flight level. Air traffic control cleared the flight to descend to flight level 100 and subsequently cleared it for runway 15 ILS approach and landing at Helsinki. The airplane landed on runway 15 at 08:15 h.

A preliminary investigation report revealed that the engine power loss resulted from a P3 line failure.
The engine-mounted HMU established the minimum and maximum limits of fuel flow to the engine as a function of P3 and the power lever position. After the loss of P3 supply, power lever movements have no effect on fuel flow to, and the power output of, an engine."

Bad weather existed along the route and weather at destination Cairo was also worsening. The crew contacted Misrair Operations and requested information about possible airports for a diversion. The crew also reported they where flying in a thunderstorm with turbulent and icing conditions. One altimeter read 24000 feet while the other read 25000 feet, the magnetic compass was unserviceable and there was a crack in a cockpit window panel due to the thunderstorm. Possible like Alexandria, Port Said and El Arish were discussed, but the flight continued to Cairo. The flight was cleared for a runway 23 approach and landing, but nothing more was heard from the flight. The aircraft had crashed and caught fire 5 km from the runway.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The accident arose from the descent of the aircraft below the safe flight altitude in the final approach and the impact of the port wing against the sand dunes lying to the northeast of the aerodrome. As a result the pilot lost control of his aircraft and hit the ground.
It is probable that the cause of descent of the aircraft below the safe level was due to the change from IFR to VFR, taking into consideration that considerable time would have been needed for the pilot to have adapted to this change in the prevailing weather conditions."""

All personnel on board were killed (8 crew members and 34 passengers, including 1 American passenger, 2 Danish passengers, 3 Hong Kong passengers, and 28 China passengers), resulting in a first-class flight accident.
Probably Cause: When making the third turn, the aircraft had slight icing, and the engine experienced a short-term power drop. The crew mistakenly thought there was a fuel supply problem, so they deployed 38Â° flaps and used a large throttle for landing descent, which led to a stall and crash to the ground.
Weather conditions: total cloud cover, cloud base at 150 meters, visibility of 3.5 kilometers, unstable weather, light rain with ice pellets, and a ground temperature of +1Â°C."

Calcutta and not making use of correct navigational facility (EA NDB at Calcutta) combined with lack of assistance from Calcutta ATC by not providing radar facilities vectoring/VDF guidance and advising the aircraft to use NDB not having adequate range""."

Probable causes
Inappropriate decision by the aircraft operator to rush the aircraft's initial route to an aerodrome unknown to the company, not appropriate to the type of aircraft and not authorised in its Operating Specifications, without at least a proper risk assessment.
Inadequate crew decision to accept and decide to proceed to an unknown aerodrome, without due knowledge of its characteristics, without prior experience or training in aerodrome operation and without at least a risk assessment.
A side runway excursion, from 24 metres from the threshold of runway 25, as a result of a probable unstabilised approach resulting in an off-axis landing.
Contributing Factors
Inefficient planning and supervision of operations by the aircraft operator, by scheduling the operation to an unknown airfield.
Failure of the company to comply with the contents of the Dispatch Manual and General Operations Manual, in relation to the procedures that must be complied with before operating new routes, new airports or special airports, in aspects such as route analysis, runway analysis, risk management and crew requirements.
Ignorance of the Tarapacá runway by the crew.

Upon touchdown, the crew proceeded to disconnect the propeller stops to use reverse power as a braking measure. However, the aircraft veered sharply to the left, off the side of the runway.
The aircraft crossed an area of vegetation and a drainage channel, suffering severe structural damage including breakage and separation of the right wing, the main landing gear and the right engine; in addition, there was a fuel spill which caused a fire on the wing.
The airport emergency services managed to control the fire and evacuate the crew and passenger on board.


PROBABLE CAUSE
Runway Excursion due to loss of directional control of the aircraft after landing by disengaging the propeller stops for aerodynamic braking at a higher than established speed, which generated an uncontrollable leftward turning moment of the trajectory, due to asymmetric thrust of the propellers.

CONTRIBUTING FACTORS
1. Performing a landing on an Unstabilised Approach, not executing the established Go-Around procedure.
2. Performing a failed landing due to asymmetric thrust of the propellers, not applying the procedure established in the Operator's QRH to shut down the failed engine.
3. Probable failure of the KTA Fuel Regulator of the Automatic Engine Rotation Frequency and Power Regulation System, which blocked the reduction of the power of the NÂ°2 engine to established operating regimes for the approach and landing.

All 23 on board were killed.
Flight 217 took off from Baku on a flight to Aktau, Kazakhstan. Some five minutes after the night-time departure, while heading over the Caspian Sea, the crew reported a systems failure. The crew lost spatial orientation and the aircraft entered a steep right downward spiral and crashed on the shore of the Caspian Sea.
It appeared that the aircraft took off with caged gyro horizons. This was a malfunction due to the fact that some counterfeit components had been installed during production.

Conclusion: The cause of the crash was the loss of controllability of the aircraft during continued take-off due to the crewÂ’s failure to comply with the climb height requirements at the recommended speed of 170 km/h due to changes in the initial flight path towards obstructions at the moment the left engine was shut down."

It was carrying one instructor, a pilot trainee and three passengers. The aircraft was flying VFR.
The instructor said that he intended to execute nine touch and go circuit operations, three of which were to be performed with 42Â° flaps, another three with 18Â° flaps and the rest with zero degree flaps.
The first six circuits were performed uneventfully. Before initiating the first flapless landing the instructor ordered the trainee to extend his approach and establish a six-mile final to runway 09. When the aircraft was established on the final for runway 09 the instructor saw that the aircraft was a bit too low and ordered the trainee to adjust his approach. After 5H-PAB was established on the approach slope the instructor advised the trainee to call when he needed props fully forward (setting propellers into full coarse pitch). This he subsequent1y did and the instructor, aware of the relatively high aircraft speed for the configuration advised the trainee to be careful on the flare in order to avoid the possibility of the tail skid hitting the ground. When the aircraft was flared, the tail skid hit and scraped the ground followed by the belly and the nose underside section. After sliding for 164 metres the aircraft came to rest on the runway with the engines still running. The instructor carried out the emergency shut down checks and evacuated the aircraft.
It was only after touch down that the crew realised that they had belly landed. The commander then proceeded to select reverse thrust. There was no fire and none of the occupants was injured.
The instructor said that he had forgotten to lower the landing gear because of his preoccupation with the rate of descent and the execution of the flapless flare. The pilot under instruction testified that he had concentrated too much an the technical side of flying to the point of forgetting to call for the gear down selection.
There was only one checklist in use in the cockpit which was contained in a book and this was being used by the instructor. The instructor testified to have used the checklist for the first six landings. The checklist was not used for the accident landing. None pilot of the pilots reported to have heard the landing gear horn.

It arrived at Tobias Bolanos as 12:53. The airplane was prepared quickly for the onward flight. The bags were loaded without weighing them and the passengers
were not briefed about the emergency procedures. The flight quickly taxied to runway 09 for departure without permission from the air traffic controller to do so. At 13:04 ATC cleared the flight for takeoff. Because the pilots did not use the check list for departure, they forgot to lower the flaps for take off.

CAUSA PROBABLE:
""Posible pÃ©rdida de control longitudinal de la aeronave en vuelo, al no alcanzar la velocidad mÃ­nima de sustentaciÃ³n, debido a la configuraciÃ³n de despegue con los flaps del aviÃ³n en cero, inadecuada para el largo de pista y la distribuciÃ³n del peso que afectÃ³ la posiciÃ³n de su centro de gravedad excediendo su lÃ­mite trasero.""

FACTORES CONTRIBUYENTES:
1. La tripulaciÃ³n no utilizÃ³ las listas de chequeo antes de despegar.
2. El sobrepeso de la aeronave en el momento del despegue.
3. La alta altitud de densidad.
4. La falta de supervisiÃ³n del despacho del vuelo por parte del operador. (Ausencia de procedimientos)

They attempted to avoid a collision, but the Mi-8's main rotors cut into the L-410's tail, causing substantial damage. Both aircraft were able to land safely.
The Mi-8 (RA-22248) was operated by Nefteyugansk Air Enterprise on behalf of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL).
It was established that the crew of the Mi-8T helicopter did not pay attention to the radio communication between the controller and the crew of the L-410 aircraft. The crew of the Mi-8T helicopter was distracted because they were talking about the barge that sank on the coast.

The aircraft climbed to height of about 200 feet when it banked to the right and left. The airplane stalled and crashed. It appeared that the distribution of the passengers in the cabin had caused the centre of gravity to be outside the limits. Also, the co-pilot did not have a type rating for Let 410 aircraft.

CONCLUSIONES:
1. La compañia Atlantic Airlines,a la fecha del accidente no contaba con personal administrativo y operativo suficientemente entrenado para un a operación segura.
2. La mala ubicación de sus pasajeros dentro de la cabina de pasajeros pudo incidir en una pérdida de sustentación (Stall de Velocidad) de la aeronave que por su baja altura fue imposible de controlar,esto lo demuestra que la aeronave se desplomó por completo sin desplazarse en el suelo y destruyéndose por el peso de los motores y sus alas que se encontraban llenas de combustible.
3. La falta de entrenamiento de la tripulación y en especial del copiloto como lo demuestra su licencia en la que no contaba con una habilitación para volar dicho tipo de aeronave, no permitió la asistencia del problema al Capitán durante toda su operación, indicando el que solo se limitó a leer la Lista de
Chequeo.
4. Los motores se encontraban operando normales al momento del impacto y sus superficies de vuelo en condidones normales de despegue.
5. No se encontraron evidencias de fallas mecánicas al momento del despegue .
6. El accidente evidencia que la aeronave se encontraba operando normalmente, pero que por circunstancias aerodinámicas adversas, entró en una pérdida de sustentación (stall), que la desplomó al suelo en forma abrupta y sin control.

The crew of the Let 410 attempted a VFR departure from MedellÃ­n in poor weather conditions (heavy rainfall and heavy winds). The flight took off from runway 01, immediately commencing a right hand turn. The crew continued the turn past the course it should have flown. A few minutes after takeoff the airplane flew into the side of Cerro El Silencio at a height of 9200 feet (2815 metres). Medellin airfield elevation is 4940 feet (1512 metres).

CAUSA: ""Inadecuada conducciÃ³n del vuelo al no seguir los procedimientos establecidos por la compaÃ±Ã­a en el manual general de operaciones para la conducciÃ³n del vuelo en la ruta MedellÃ­n-Quibdo, ni el plan de vuelo solicitado y aprobado.

(Inadequate conduction of the flight by not following the procedures established by the company in the general manual of operations for the conduction of the flight on the MedellÃ­n-Quibdo route, nor by following the approved flight plan. The formation of towering cumulus in the zone and mentioned in the reports to the hour of the accident made it difficult to carry out the flight under visual flight rules, as far as the visibility and distances of the clouds that the regulations for the conduction of this type of flights stipulates.)

The aircraft departed Abuja around 16:30 for a passenger flight to Port Harcourt. At Port Harcourt all passengers disembarked. The aircraft then took off for a ferry flight to Calabar. On approach the pilot declared an emergency due to an electrical failure. At 65 km out the crew commenced a descent to 2500 feet. The descent was continued past this altitude until the Let crashed in a swamp. During the investigation into the cause of the accident it was found out that the aircraft was non-compliant with the maintenance requirements, and proper documentation of the aircraft and crew members. Also, the plane had exceeded the prescribed annual inspection time by 248 hours, and the engines were not maintained in accordance with the standard procedure. Contrary to NCAA regulations a Flight Data Recorder (FDR), nor a Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) were installed.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The premature departure of the plane from the normal minimum safe altitude of 2500 ft without air traffic controller's clearance until it flew into the terrain. Other contributing factors are the emergence of electrical problem on the aircraft on the commencement of its approach which might have distracted the attention of the pilot from having undistorted focus on the instruments, and unfavourable weather conditions of low cloud base and
thunderstorm which impaired visibility at the critical time of descent.""

The flight then continued to Voyager in order refuel. Leaving Voyager, the aircraft was flown to Musiara to pick up eighteen passengers bound for Mombasa. The passengers were already at the airstrip and waiting by the time the aircraft landed at Musiara airstrip.
The crew switched off one engine leaving the other running and the co-pilot proceeded to board the passengers. He also gave the passenger briefing informing his passengers about flight times as well as the expected weather en-route. After the passenger briefing, the crew went ahead with preparations for takeoff. The captain gave his co-pilot a briefing on how they would use the water methanol system for takeoff, then went ahead with the takeoff.
The aircraft successfully lifted off the ground and the landing gear and flaps were selected up. Forty-five seconds into the flight, the no. 1 engine stopped. The crew identified the failed engine, and proceeded to attempt a restart. They made one failed attempt and elected to make a landing in the next suitable airstrip where they would figure out a suitable way to address the problem. The closest airstrip was Ol Kiombo, which was 18 kilometers along the aircraft flight path and three kilometers to the right of the flight path. By the time the crew identified the airstrip, it was already too late to make a direct landing on runway 09. The aircraft was also loosing altitude. The crew then attempted to line up the aircraft for a landing on the opposite runway but lost height and made a crash landing straight ahead. The aircraft impacted the ground in flat attitude, dragged along, hit an anthill and turned one hundred and eighty degrees, finally settling astride a stream. The co-pilot was thrown out of the aircraft and critically injured and died shortly thereafter. The aircraft suffered extensive damage and the captain and the passengers suffered serious injuries.

An investigation of the engine did not reveal any damage. The cause of the engine stop could not be determined.

CAUSE: ""The most likely cause of the accident was the inability of the crew to manage the emergency brought about by the failure of the left engine.
Failure of the engine as well as the lack of methodical approach to the failure contributed to the accident. ""

The aircraft in question was owned by Mr Yu. M Kabanov, deputy director of the Aviation Complex Myachkovo (AKM) and used by the Borki Air Club. On the day of the accident 23 skydivers boarded the Let 410. This was illegal since the maximum number of skydivers allowed on a Let 410 is 12 with lateral seating. In this case nearly all skydivers were sitting on the airplane's floor, one even occupied the toilet. As a result the airplane was overloaded by 618 kg and the centre of gravity was probably about 32% MAC where the maximum rear CofG was 28% MAC. At an altitude of about 3900 metres eleven skydivers prepared to exit the plane. When four of them had gotten out the CofG moved further aft (probably to about 35%) causing the Let to pitch up. The plane stalled, fell to the left and descended out of control. At an altitude of 2000 metres the aft fuselage section failed.

Shortly after takeoff the pilot requested clearance to return to the airport in order to close the door of the forward baggage hold, which had apparently opened during takeoff. On the right base leg when starting the turn onto final, the aircraft stalled and impacted a sugar cane field.

MAIN CAUSE (translated from original French language report):
Stall during approach phase while on the downwind leg caused by the loss of VMC at low altitude.

CONTRIBUTING FACTORS:
1) failure of the crew to manage the approach procedure (Poor CRM)
a) use of maximum flaps (42Â°)
b) insufficient altitude
c) lack of coordination between crew members
2) possible state of fatigue of the captain
3) Possible excess weight
4) opening of the baggage hold door, observed during takeoff.

At 04:10 UTC it was cleared to the local flying area for upper air works, followed by VOR/ILS approaches to runway 09 via NDB KB. 5H-PAC took off and proceeded to the local flying area where the crew members did upper air works for about 30 minutes. According to the commander, these included clean and dirty stalls, level flights at different speeds, 45 degree turns left and right and exercises on unusual attitudes. Subsequent to these they returned to the airport via NDB KB for ILS approach to runway 09. They carried out a missed approach and proceeded to join right hand circuits for touch-and-go operations on runway 09. The last operations before the accident was simulated engine failure after take off followed by single engine overshoot, this time using runway 27.
This was approved and the commander was reminded that the surface wind was 090 degrees 08 knots. The aircraft turned left and positioned on right base for runway 27. It was subsequently given a landing clearance. The controller, who was handling the flight, said that the final approach was perfect. The landing gear was down. The aircraft passed the threshold of runway 27 at about 70 feet above the ground and continued to flare on a straight and level attitude with the landing gear retracted. It continued in this attitude for a distance of about one and a half kilometers down the runway subsequent to which it drifted off the runway to the right. The controller asked the pilot to explain his intentions. There was no reply. Instead, the aircraft was observed to yaw violently as it drifted further to the right. Moments later, it impacted the ground on a grass hedge and skidded along the width of taxiway Y before it came to rest. The commander said that he took the controls immediately when the aircraft started yawing but there was no time effect recovery.
There was fuel spillage but fire did not break out. The two pilots, who had not put on their shoulder straps, sustained facial injuries.

CONCLUSIONS: ""Given that the aircraft was practicing a single engine overshoot, the pilot appears to have descended too low for safe recovery. The landing gear should also have been retracted after power had been applied and positive climb achieved. The standard single engine overshoot procedure was not applied.""

After the second pass, the crew continued the left circuit to the final approach fot RWY 24.
The radio transmission from the ground was significantly interfered with by noise. The reception of this information was mutually confirmed by the pilots via intercom. However, subsequent communication between the pilots over the intercom to resolve the situation overrode the reception of the AFIS information, which alerted them to the retracted landing gear of their aircraft. The pilots concentrated on resolving the situation with the persons on the RWY and did not deploy the landing gear. The next transmission from the AFIS dispatcher's ground radio, which alerted the pilots to the retracted landing gear, was pre-modulated and therefore unintelligible and was not received by the pilots of the aeroplane. The pilots of the aeroplane did not hear the gear-up warning tone until shortly before the aeroplane made contact with the surface of the RWY, when they moved the engine power levers to the idle position. They then realised their error, but it was too late to correct it. The aeroplane came to rest on the centreline of RWY 24.

CAUSAS PROBABLES: ""La no observancia de los procedimientos descritos para la falla de un motor luego de V1, en especial los que se refieren al mantenimiento de la velocidad de despegue seguro de 84 nudos, la retracciÃ³n de la aleta de banqueo automÃ¡tico, la operaciÃ³n de la palanca del tren de aterrizaje y el empleo de la potencia de contingencia.

La operaciÃ³n errÃ³nea de la palanca de combustible FCL del motor uno, al moverla desde la posiciÃ³n abierta a cerrada durante la cadena de eventos, con lo que se dejÃ³ sin empuje al aviÃ³n y la operaciÃ³n no apropiada de la palanca de combustible FCL del motor dos, al llevarla a la posiciÃ³n MAX NG en un intento por obtener rendimiento de dicho motor.

El mantenimiento del aviÃ³n en una actitud de despegue luego de la falla del motor dos con la consecuente reducciÃ³n de velocidad y posteriormente el mantenimiento del aviÃ³n en una actitud de ascenso, luego de haber apagado el motor uno, con lo que se llegÃ³ a la velocidad de pÃ©rdida de sustentaciÃ³n y la posterior ausencia de control de la aeronave.

La falla del motor dos por motivos indeterminados durante la carrera de despegue, luego de V1, lo que obligÃ³ a la tripulaciÃ³n a realizar una serie de procedimientos de emergencia para afrontar la falla y continuar con el ascenso inicial.

La ausencia o falencia de manejo de recursos de cabina entre los miembros de la tripulaciÃ³n durante la secuencia de eventos.

La reducciÃ³n en una medida no determinada de la alerta situacional de la tripulaciÃ³n como resultado de la situaciÃ³n financiera de la empresa y de la separaciÃ³n en la que estaba inmerso el CapitÃ¡n de la aeronave.""

unofficial translation from Spanish:
PROBABLE CAUSES: ""The non-observance of the procedures described for an engine failure after V1, especially those relating to the maintenance of safe takeoff speed of 84 knots, the retraction of the flaps, automatic operation of the landing gear lever and the use of contingency power.
The erroneous operation of the fuel-flow-control lever (FCL) of engine number one, the move from the open to the closed position during the chain of events, which left the plane and the inappropriate use of the fuel-flow-control lever (FCL) of engine number two, to bring it to the MAX NG position in an attempt to obtain performance of the engine.
Maintaining an attitude of the plane on take-off after nr. 2 engine failure with the consequent reduction of speed and then maintaining the aircraft in a climbing attitude, after an engine shutdown, which came at stall speed and the subsequent lack of control of the aircraft.
The failure of the engine for undetermined reasons during the takeoff roll, after V1, which forced the crew to perform a series of emergency procedures to deal with the fault and continue with the initial climb.
The absence or failure of resource management among flight crew members during the sequence of events.
The unmeasureable reduction in the situational awareness of the crew as a result of the financial situation of the company and the divorce in which the Captain of the aircraft was involved.""

The aircraft, in cargo configuration, was used to carry a cargo consisting of small packages for a total weight of 1600 kg. On board, in addition to the two pilots, the commander's wife was also present as a passenger.
The weather conditions were characterized by calm wind and dense fog, which limited visibility to less than 400m. After several requests from the captain, the aircraft was cleared for start-up and taxiing; the aircraft followed the follow-me vehicle from apron 12, where it was stationed, to the runway 28 threshold, as required by Orio al Serio Airport procedures for operations in very low visibility conditions.
After take-off, the aircraft was cleared for SID ""ORI 5Q"", which provided, for the initial climb, the maintenance of the runway heading up to 2 NM.
The aircraft, however, began a slight turn to the left, which, in an increasingly accentuated manner, led it to reverse its flight direction and quickly lose altitude, until it hit the ground with a heading opposite the take-off heading, about one kilometer from the runway, after about one minute of flight. The impact occurred in a ploughed field, after hitting and cutting the cables of a medium voltage power line at the edge of the field.

CAUSES:
As far as is established, documented and substantiated, the cause of the accident is due to a loss of control in flight of the aircraft. Although the cause of this loss of control could not be established with incontrovertible certainty, it can reasonably be assumed that it was caused by a deterioration in the situation awareness of the crew during the initial climb immediately after take-off.
The loss of such situation awareness may have been contributed jointly or severally:
- the displacement or incorrect positioning of the load, which would have induced a moment of rotation on the longitudinal axis of the aircraft (roll) not immediately perceived and counteracted by the crew;
- spatial disorientation, as a result of the possible optical illusion produced by the high speed ""E"" TWY lights, which, crossing the thick fog, could have induced the pilot to veer, thus causing the final loss of control of the aircraft.
In addition, the limited flight experience of the co-pilot and the inadequate application of CRM techniques by the crew did not allow for a timely identification of the hazardous situation and the necessary actions to recover the aircraft.

The airplane was expected to arrive at 18:02. After takeoff the crew requested cancellation of their IFR flight plan ant to continue under visual flight rules at FL45. This was approved. Upon request, the flight was cleared to descend to 2000 feet to avoid an area of poor weather. About 17:39 a left turn was initiated towards the coast line for the same reason. The airplane struck trees near the top of Pico da Pedra Bonita at an elevation of 1920 feet.

CONTRIBUTING FACTORS (translated from Portuguese)
1. Human factors
Psychological - Contributed

It was found that the decision of the crew to cancel the IFR plan to continue VFR at low altitude and when visibility is not favorable, has been inadequate, with compliance of the pilots with such a decision.
It is possible that the knowledge of the region obtained by the instructor captain caused over-confidence, influencing the decision.
The organizational culture of the company proved to be complacent by not inhibiting the adoption of procedures incompatible with flight safety, such as the low altitude flights made by the instructor captain.

Operational Aspect
a. Judgement - Contributed
There was inadequate assessment of the situation by the crew, causing them to fly at a lower altitude than the safe limits under visual conditions unsuitable for visual flight, resulting in the collision of the aircraft with high ground.

b. Coordination Cabin - Contributed
The use of human resources for the operation of the aircraft was unsuitable because of failure to comply with operational standards, leading the crew to perform a passenger flight to the lower altitude limits of safety, under inadequate visual conditions.

c. Planning - Contributed
The preparation for the flight proved inadequate because the crew did not have a meteorological analysis of the appropriate level of flight performed, considering that the conditions for the region were overshadowing the Serra do Mar and surrounding areas of low clouds and / or mist, especially on the slopes of the mountain.

d. Adverse weather conditions - Contributors
The weather conditions prevailing in the region made visual flight impossible, resulting in the concealment of the elevation at which the aircraft crashed.

e. Flight indiscipline - Contributed
The pilots intentionally not complying with rules of air traffic and civil aviation rules, without grounds, performing flight at low altitude, under conditions of visibility below the limits established for VFR flight, colliding with high ground.

f Supervision - Contributed
The company has not taken appropriate supervisory measures, enabling the existence of a culture of undeveloped flight safety, which prevented advance identification of actions taken by the crew and injured misconception exists in the CRM business, which represented a potential risk to their operations, as well as by the failure of some educational measures provided for in its PPAA (Plan for the Prevention of Aeronautical Accidents).

Weather was in part: partly obscured, 200' overcast, visibility 3/4 mi with light drizzle and fog, wind calm.
While landing, flight 993 was advized to turn right when able and to contact ground control 'leaving the runway.' At 12:16:53, flight 993 transmitted to ground control that the flt was off the rwy. At 12:17:00, ground control told flt 993 to 'give way to the Mitsubishi, then taxi to ramp via echo. . .' At about that time, an elt activated as the 2 aircraft collided. Investigation revealed the 1st officer of flt 993 made the landing, turned off on taxiway echo and began to cross taxiway alpha. Taxiway echo angled off the rwy, but was not a high speed taxiway, though the captain of flt 993 thought it was. Collision occurred at the intersection of the taxiways.
Neither crew saw the other aircraft until moments before impact. The controller's view of taxiway alpha was partly blocked by obstructions; the ground controller did not advize Icarus 60 of the position of flt 993 or instruct him to hold short of the intersection. The captain of Icarus 60 had looked away for another aircraft just before impact.

Probable Cause: FAILURE OF THE CREW OF BROCKWAY FLIGHT 993 TO SEE-AND-AVOID THE OTHER AIRCRAFT DUE TO THE FIRST OFFICER'S INADEQUATE VISUAL LOOKOUT & THE CAPTAIN'S INADEQUATE SUPERVISION. FACTORS RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WERE: THE WEATHER CONDITION, AND THE GROUND CONTROLLER'S FAILURE TO PROVIDE A TRAFFIC ADVISORY TO ICARUS 60.

With the undercarriage down and the flaps still in takeoff position the airplane impacted a house in the suburban Paranaque neighbourhood. All 21 aboard the plane and a family of four inside the house were killed.

The probable cause of the accident was determined to be a failure to maintain adequate flying speed and altitude due to the pilot's inability to properly perform the specified emergency procedures following a malfunction of the right engine immediately after take-off. A contributing factor was a 'material failure' of the engine."

The instructor disabled the student's attitude indicator and an engine failure was simulated in the procedure turn for an instrument approach. The student became disoriented and asked the instructor to take control, which he refused. The aircraft later struck the sea.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The instructor pilot's loss of altitude awareness and possible spatial disorientation, which resulted in the loss of control of the airplane at an altitude too low for recovery; and company management's lack of involvement in and oversight of its Beechcraft 1900 flight training program. Contributing to the accident was the instructor pilot's exercise of poor judgment in establishing a flight situation and airplane configuration conducive to spatial disorientation that afforded the pilots little or no margin for error.""
The ALPA did not agree with the probable cause adopter by the NTSB. In a 1997 ALPA petition they claim that a whirl mode flutter was induced to the right engine and propeller assembly, due to pre-existing right engine truss tube failures. This whirl mode flutter caused a catastrophic failure within the truss mount system. This failure allowed the right engine and nacelle to depart the right wing. The right engine struck and removed the right horizontal stabilizer. The propeller probably damaged the left horizontal stabilizer. The aircraft then pitched over violently and instantly and crashed.

The airplane received substantial damage as a result of the collision. The two flight crew members and 16 passengers on board the airplane reported no injuries. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.
The captain reported the flight was cleared to parking via the inner Echo (E) taxiway. He stated as they neared the commuter airplane parking area, they encountered a DC-9 positioned on the inner taxiway centerline, blocking their progress. The captain reported he considered taxiing around the DC-9 on the outer Echo taxiway, but decided against it because of other traffic and the DC-9 jetwash. Instead, the captain elected to taxi on the parking ramp, passing between a parked commuter airplane and the DC-9. He reported he and the first officer did not observe any obstacles on the parking ramp, and proceeded to taxi ""...at an extremely slow taxi speed..."" past the stationary airplanes. The captain stated as they passed between the airplanes they heard a loud noise and felt extreme vibrations, as the airplane struck the untended objects.

The captain stated the night was dark, with light snow falling, and the parking ramp was not well lit. He stated there was no reflective tape on the baggage cart or step stool, nor was there anything else to draw attention to the objects. He indicated he had turned off the taxi light (per company general operating procedures) so as not to blind the DC-9 flight crew.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot-in-command's failure to maintain clearance from obstacles during taxi operations. Related factors are the dark night light conditions and the wrong taxi route.""

A witness observed the airplane in a high flare above the runway threshold, watched it drop vertically, landing hard on the main landing gear, bounce and bank to the left. The left wing struck the runway, the airplane veered to the left, and departed the runway. The Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) Study showed that while on approach, the airplane rolled approximately 20 degrees to the right. During this roll 'it appears that full power was applied to the engines.' The right engine reached full power about '2 seconds' before the left engine, and this occurrence was immediately followed by a 38 degree roll to the left and then a three-plus 'g' spike in the vertical acceleration when the wings became level again. According to the captain's statement, he took control of the airplane after it yawed from right to left. The flight initially touched down at 584 feet from the end of Runway 14, the left wing tip touched the pavement three separate times before the aircraft departed the runway at a 40 degree angle, traveling through rough terrain and coming to rest approximately 1148 feet from the point where it exited the runway. The FO's date of hire was 1/9/96, and this was her first line trip with the airline.

Probable Cause: the pilot misjudged the flare during landing. Factors in the accident were: an improper recovery from a bounced landing, and the first officers lack of experience in this type operation.

The separated counterweight and clamp struck the adjacent blade and caused the blade to separate about 12 inches from the hub. The resultant imbalance caused severe vibration from the right engine. The propeller governor struck the engine cowling and broke into pieces. The flight crew shutdown the engine using the condition lever. The propeller did not feather when commanded by the flight crew, and it continued to windmill causing vibration and drag until landing. Metallurgical examination indicated a blade counterweight clamp screw failed causing the clamp to separate. The screw fracture surface initiated at the screw threads and had features typical of intergranular cracking. Cadmium, which is used as a plating on the screw after manufacturer, was present on the fracture surface.

Probable Cause: Failure of a blade counterweight clamp retaining screw due to cadmium embrittlement which occurred during the manufacture process. This resulted in the counterweight clamp separating and striking the adjacent blade causing it to separate.

During landing roll, when passing through approximately 60 knots, the right main landing gear indication gave an intermittent unsafe indication. The pilot flying added power to go-around and the right main landing gear collapsed. The aircraft rolled/slid to a stop on the runway and an uneventful evacuation was conducted. Examination of the right main landing gear assembly provided evidence that the extension/retraction actuator had failed at the spherical bearing. Metallurgical examination found the spherical bearing had failed in fatigue and evidenced by wear and binding in certain positions. It was dry and there was no evidence of lubrication. A review of maintenance procedures and records for the aircraft revealed that all maintenance and inspections had been performed in accordance with applicable directives.

Probable Cause: fatigue failure of the right main landing gear hydraulic actuator rod at the spherical bearing due to a lack of lubrication.

Investigation revealed that a bearing in the forward cabin ventilation blower motor had failed. There was evidence that after the bearing had failed, the wires and resistors to the ventilation motor had overheated. The wires were charred and sooted on the blower motor housing. The resistors (for low speed fan operation) showed signs of heat damage. Current limiters were provided to protect the electrical circuit. However, research revealed that the wiring and resistors were not adequately protected in the low speed fan mode.

Probable Cause: failure of a forward cabin ventilation blower motor bearing, which resulted in binding of the blower motor; and inadequate design of the electrical system, which allowed overheating of the electrical circuit and smoke in the cabin of the aircraft.

Smoke was coming out of the bottom left corner of the first officer's windscreen. The first officer, using the portable halon fire extinguisher, extinguished a 6 to 8 inch flame that had erupted from behind the glareshield. The PIC completed the approach and landing. Examination of the windshield by the manufacturer indicated that the source of the excessive heat that caused the windshield and aircraft materials to smoke and ultimately burn, was determined to be arcing of a damaged low power braided copper lead wire. The examiner reported that, 'It is, however, our opinion that the damage was done to the braid wire during the windshield manufacturing process.' The origin of the fracture of the inboard glass ply was in the bottom center post corner area located near the low power terminal block. The examiner reported that, 'the glass fracture occurred as a result of the intensive heat due to electrical arcing of the severed low power lead wire.'

Probable Cause: the short in the windshield anti-ice low power braided copper lead wire caused a fire that had resulted from the manufacturer's inadequate design.

Examination of the aircraft, crew, luggage, and cargo provided no evidence of a problem and neither crew member had any physical manifestations such as smell or irritation. One passenger indicated the possibility of dizziness. No other aircraft in the area at the time reported any difficulty. A test flight was conducted using the same crew, aircraft, route, and altitude. During the flight, tests were performed by a industrial hygienist with negative results.

After an intermediate stop at Burlington, the Beechcraft 1900 took off again for Quincy at 16:40 local time. As the Beechcraft was approaching Quincy, two aircraft were ready for departure.
A Beechcraft 65-A90 King Air (N1127D) and Piper PA-28 (N7646J) were taxiing to runway 04. Since Quincy is an uncontrolled airport, all 3 aircraft used a common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF). The United Express crew asked for the first time whether the King Air was holding short or was going to depart at 16:59:29. The King Air crew didn't respond, so the King Air was asked again if they were holding short, at 17:00:16. This time the Cherokee pilot responded he was holding short of runway 04. Because of the GPWS 200 feet altitude warning in the Beech 1900 cockpit, just the last part of the transmission, including the words ""King Air"" were heard.
Probably thinking the King Air was holding short, the United Express crew continued their approach to runway 13. The King Air however, had taxied onto the runway and had started its takeoff roll when the Beech 1900 touched down. A collision took place at the runway 04/13 intersection. Both aircraft skidded for 110 feet and came to rest along the east edge of runway 13 with the Beech 1900's right wing interlocked with the left wing of the King Air. Both aircraft caught fire immediately.
Three pilots witnessed the accident and rushed to the scene. With the right side of the Beech 1900 on fire, they went to the right side and saw the captain with her head and one arm out of the window, shouting ""get the door open!"". Several attempts to open the door failed until the left wing buckled, causing the nose wheel and cockpit to fall to the right. Attempts by passengers to open the door from the inside had also failed.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the failure of the pilots in the King Air A90 to effectively monitor the common traffic advisory radio frequency or to properly scan for traffic, resulting in their commencing a takeoff roll when the Beech 1900C (United Express flight 5925) was landing on an intersecting runway.
Contributing to the cause of the accident was the Cherokee pilot's interrupted radio transmission, which led to the Beech 1900C pilots' misunderstanding of the transmission as an indication from the King Air that it would not take off until after flight 5925 had cleared the runway.
Contributing to the severity of the accident and the loss of life was the lack of adequate aircraft rescue and firefighting services, and the failure of the air stair door on the Beech 1900C to open.""

The airplane lifted from the runway with the stall horn on, and above V1 speed the PIC called out to abort. The FO aborted the takeoff and landed the airplane on the runway. The airplane then entered a snow bank on the left side of the runway. Service Difficulty Reports revealed other stall horn activation's had occurred on takeoff; several occurred after deicing and were attributed to frozen stall vanes on the wing. The accident airplane had been deiced prior to the takeoff. The BE1900 check list called for the stall vane heat to be turned on just before takeoff. Stall training provided by the operator did not include BE1900 simulators, and all recoveries were initiated at the stall horn. The FAA practical test standard for type ratings required the recognition of the stall buffet, stick shaker, or decay of control effectiveness. The flight crew had not received winter operations training, and this was the Boston based PIC's third takeoff in snow. Multiple FAA inspections over several years revealed the Operator was not in compliance with regulations, which included their training program; however, they continued to operate unrestricted. Airport operations had ceased snow plowing the 300 foot wide runway to accommodate airline operations, and reported the runway had been plowed 75 feet west and 150 feet east of runway center. The runway was measured to be plowed 55 feet left of center, with a 1 foot high, and 10 foot wide pile of snow on the west side of the runway. The plowed portion had an icy covering.

Probable Cause: The inadequate flight and winter operations training provided by the operator, and the pilot's improper decision to abort the takeoff while airborne above V1, due to a false stall warning horn. Also casual was the airport operations improper decision to discontinue plowing, and their failure to remove a snow pile on the runway. Factors relating to the accident were an easterly crosswind, the narrow icy runway conditions, inadequate FAA oversight in allowing the operator to continue operations with an inadequate training program that continued over several years, and the manufacturer's checklist which delayed the activation of the stall vane heat until just prior to takeoff.

The flying pilot (1st officer) was able to counter the roll by applying almost full opposite aileron, during which time, he felt the aileron jam momentarily and then break free. The airplane landed without further incident. An examination revealed that the inboard, aft end of the right wing outboard flap was detached from the wing flap track. This resulted in flap asymmetry and mechanical interference with the aileron. The flap track roller bearing was seized and the flap mounting bracket was torn and separated from the bearing. The bearing outer roller was loose and could be shifted axially on the bearing outer ring. This allowed the outer roller flange to wear against and eventually tear through the flap mounting bracket. The operator was not using the most recent (revised) Beech 1900D maintenance manuals at the time of the incident and the airplane had not been subjected to a detailed inspection of the flap roller brackets, roller bearings, and attachment hardware as outlined in revised sections of the manual.

Probable Cause: an axial shift of the aft flap track bearing's outer roller, resulting in erosion and failure of the flap track bracket/bearing assembly. A factor relating to the incident was: inadequate inspection of the flap roller bearing/bracket assemblies.

The captain reported that as the gear was brought up on takeoff, the flightcrew heard a 'loud wind noise.' He stated that they had no indications of anything wrong on the annunciator panel (which contains a red CARGO DOOR warning light to indicate that the cargo door is open or not secure.) He reported that they then looked in the back of the aircraft, and the passengers told them that the cargo door had come open. The crew then returned to land. An inventory of the cargo compartment contents after landing revealed that no baggage had been lost. During postaccident examination of the aircraft, the aft cargo door locking handle was observed in the unlocked position as the door was swung down, and visual inspection of the aft cargo door locks, switches, and annunciator cargo door warning systems found no discrepancies with the aft cargo door or its indicating/warning system.

Probable Cause: the flightcrew's inadequate preflight, and the ramp agent's inadequate dispatch of the aircraft. The unsecured cargo door was a factor.

He noted aileron binding as the flaps traveled to 35 degrees, and at the same time heard a snap under the floor of the cockpit. After landing the flaps were not retracted. The airplane was taxied to the terminal where it was observed that the right outboard flap panel had became detached from the flap aft roller bearings at the inboard flap track. The flap was in contact with the aileron, which interfered with aileron control. The manufacturer had published a Safety Communique during May 1997. The Communique dealt with the inspection of the outboard flap attachment brackets and aft roller bearings of Beech 1900 series airplanes. The incident airplane was scheduled to have the inspection complied with during the next 30 days. The airplane had accumulated about 3,317 flight hours and 7,069 landings. An inspection of the remainder of the operator's fleet of Beech 1900D airplanes revealed that eight additional airplanes failed the inspection criteria, but had not reached the assigned number of cycles specified in the Communique.

Probable Cause: The right outboard flap detaching from the flap aft roller bearings, at the flap track, which was a result of the manufacturer's inadequate inspection program.

The tug driver said he may have lost consciousness after striking a bump in the access road. The police reported the bump was at the point where the access road intersected the taxiway, and the intersection was controlled by a stop sign on the access road. The Police Officer issued a citation to the tug driver for violation of a county ordinance, which stated, 'Aircraft always have the right-of-way in the AOA.

The pilot returned and landed at the departure airport without further incident. Examination revealed the left engine's number two propeller counterweight had separated, and exited through the propeller spinner. The counterweight then impacted the number one propeller blade, of the left engine, which separated about 12 inches from the hub. Examination of the counterweight clamp leading edge bolt hole revealed that the internal threads in the hole were stripped by motion of the leading edge bolt out of the hole. Additionally, the hole contained a double set of thread roots, indicative of cross threading of a bolt or mistapping of the threads. The propeller counterweight bolts had been replaced during an overhaul performed by the propeller manufacturer on April 12, 1995. The propeller counterweight bolts were also replaced by a certified propeller repair station, during maintenance on April 8, 1996, and at the last overhaul, which was performed on January 28, 1997. According to the propeller overhaul manual, after removal of a counterweight clamp bolt, an undersized tap should be used to remove the loctite retaining compound which was to be applied to the counterweight clamp threads during installation. The manual also stated '...Visually inspect threads for damage. Cross threading, damaged or missing threads is cause for retirement of the clamp.' A representative from the propeller repair station stated that their mechanics use a compressed air plastic bead spray to clean the clamp threads and they do not use an undersized tap. According to the propeller manufacturer, the use of a compressed air plastic bead spray to clean the propeller counterweight clamp threads was not an approved procedure.

Probable Cause: Improper maintenance which resulted in a cross threaded\ mistapped counterweight bolt hole, and the subsequent failure of the propeller counterweight clamp assembly. Also causal was the inadequate inspection of the counterweight clamp threads by maintenance personnel which failed to detect the damaged counterweight threads.

The hijackers forced the plane to divert to a remote airstrip at a cattle ranch. They released the passengers and crew and took the plane to Colombia, where it was recovered in early August. It is believed that drug traffickers were responsible for this hijacking as they have a history of stealing small and medium-sized aircraft for use in smuggling operations.

Both aircraft crashed into the sea, 1,5 km from the 980 feet long cruise ship 'SS Norway' and sank 30-50 feet below the sea level.
The Cessna was on a private flight from the nearby Vannes airfield.
Just prior to the collision the pilot of the Beechcraft had requested permission to modify their flight plan and to descend below 3000 feet in uncontrolled airspace under VFR conditions. This was probably done to take a detour and overfly the cruise ship, which is the biggest ocean liner ever built in France.
The Cardinal pilot was a 69-years old retired Air Inter captain with over 20000 hours of flying time.

One passenger sustained a minor injury.
The airplane taxied from its gate at 17:10, and took off from runway 17R at 17:14. Reaching 500 feet agl after takeoff, the crew heard a loud 'bang,' followed by slight vibration from the left prop. The aircraft returned for a landing on runway 17L at 17:19.

Postaccident examination revealed the entire erosion shield was missing. There were three holes punctured in the fuselage. The first hole was about 12 inches aft of the airstair door and just above the cabin window. The second hole was slightly higher than the first. The third hole was at the top of the fuselage. A portion of the erosion shield entered the cabin and knocked out the overhead passenger service unit at seat 1A. Two small dents were found in the ceiling. The inner window pane at seat 2C was punctured and a piece of the erosion shield was found lodged between the inner and outer panes. Another piece was found between the ceiling and the pressure vessel. The passenger seated in row 2C sustained a small cut on his forehead when he was grazed by a piece of the shrapnel. He refused medical treatment.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Debonding of the propeller erosion shield due to an improper overhaul and repair by other maintenance personnel.""

At about 08:45, 28nm east of Saint-Augustin, just before leaving cruising altitude at FL100, the first officer contacted the authorized approach UNICOM (AAU) radiotelephone operator, who provided the following information: the runway was snow-covered, the ceiling was 300 feet, visibility was a quarter of a mile in snow flurries, the winds were from the southeast at 15 knots gusting to 20 knots, and the altimeter setting was 29.80 inches of mercury. Because of the winds, the captain decided to conduct the LOC/DME approach for runway 20. At 08:59, the aircraft flew into the frozen surface of the Saint-Augustin River at about 109 knots. The aircraft was on the final approach path 0.7 nm from the runway threshold. The crash occurred 1 400 feet from either side of the river. The aircraft bounced before coming to a halt on its belly 1 300 feet farther on.

FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: ""1. The crew did not follow the company's SOPs for the briefing preceding the approach and for a missed approach.; 2. In the approach briefing, the captain did not specify the MDA or the MAP, and the first officer did not notice these oversights, which shows a lack of coordination within the crew.; 3. The captain continued descent below the MDA without establishing visual contact with the required references.; 4. The first officer probably had difficulty perceiving depth because of the whiteout.; 5. The captain did not effectively monitor the flight parameters because he was trying to establish visual contact with the runway.; 6. The chief pilot (the captain of C-FGOI) set a bad example to the pilots under him by using a dangerous method, that is, descending below the MDA without establishing visual contact with the required references and using the GPWS to approach the ground.""

Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed for the positioning flight which had departed Boston, Massachusetts, at 16:00.
At dusk, with a 100-foot ceiling in fog, the captain of the Beech 1900D had performed two missed approaches to the airport. On the third approach, both the captain and first officer visually acquired the runway. The first officer said the captain lined the airplane up with the runway centerline and requested landing flaps. The first officer further stated, '...the aircraft floated at appr. 20' [feet] over the runway at a normal transition when I heard the captain taking the power levers over the 'FI [flight idle] gate' by the sound of the engine/props.' This placed the propellers in the 'BETA' range. The airplane then started to sink, and the captain pulled back on the control yoke. The main landing gear struck the ground and were fractured during the +2.9G touchdown, which occurred about 2,500 feet beyond the approach end of the 5,252 foot long runway. The airplane departed the right side of the runway, about 4,700 feet beyond the approach end, and stopped. To place the throttles in BETA, it was necessary to lift the power levers over the flight idle stop.

The captain's improper placement of the power levers in the BETA position, while the airplane was inflight. Factors were the fog and dusk conditions.

During the approach and landing, neither the first officer nor the captain observed any traffic on taxiway M. After landing of runway 35L, the local controller instructed the crew to 'exit [on] either high speed taxiway,' and to contact ground control. Because of the long landing roll and low exit speed, the first officer elected to exit the runway on high speed turnoff M6. After crossing the 'Hold Short' lines, the captain contacted ground control and was given instructions to 'taxi via Mike, enter the ramp, Bravo November, and give way to the King Air.'
The captain then sighted the approaching Beech C90A, and maximum brakes were applied. The pilot of N91KA had been cleared to taxi from the general aviation ramp to runway 8 via taxiway M. As he passed a high speed exit, he saw the Beech 1900D out the right cockpit window and heard the ground controller tell the pilot to yield.

Probable Cause: The flight crew exceeding the limits of their ATC clearance, and the failure of both flight crews to maintain adequate visual lookouts. A factor was the other aircraft taxiing on the ground.

The crew decided to carry out a straight-in GPS approach to runway 31. However, there is no published GPS approach for that runway. The descent from cruise flight into the airport was started late, and the aircraft was high and fast during the approach phase to the NDB. From an altitude of 10 000 feet at 9 nm from the NDB, the rate of descent generally exceeded 3000 fpm. The aircraft crossed the beacon at 600 feet asl. For the last 30 seconds of flight and from approximately 3 nm from the threshold, the aircraft descended steadily at approximately 850 fpm, at 140 to 150 knots indicated airspeed, with full flaps extended. The captain coached the first officer throughout the descent and called out altitudes and distances. The GPWS ""Minimums"" activation sounded, consistent with the decision height selection of 100 feet, to which the captain responded with directions to continue a slow descent. The last call was at 30 feet, 1.2 seconds before impact. Eight seconds before impact, the GPWS voice message ""Minimums, Minimums"" activated. The aircraft continued to descend and struck trees in a near-level attitude, in an area of rising terrain. A post-crash fire destroyed the wings, the right engine, and the right midside of the fuselage. The cabin area remained relatively intact, but the cockpit area separated and was crushed during the impact sequence. The Beechcraft in question was a brand new aircraft, registered just 2 months earlier. This accident was Regionnair's second Beech 1900 loss in 1999; on January 4 an accident happened on approach to St. Augustin River. No one received fatal injuries in that accident however.

CONCLUSIONS:
FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS:
1. The pilot flying did not establish a maximum performance climb profile, although required by the company's standard operating procedures (SOPs), when the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) ""Terrain, Terrain"" warning sounded during the descent, in cloud, to the non-directional beacon (NDB).
2. The pilot flying did not fly a stabilized approach, although required by the company's SOPs. The crew did not carry out a go-around when it was clear that the approach was not stabilized.
3. The crew descended the aircraft well below safe minimum altitude while in instrument meteorological conditions.
4. Throughout the approach, even at 100 feet above ground level (agl), the captain asked the pilot flying to continue the descent without having established any visual contact with the runway environment.
5. After the GPWS ""Minimums, Minimums"" voice activation at 100 feet agl, the aircraft's rate of descent continued at 850 feet per minute until impact.
6. The crew planned and conducted, in cloud and low visibility, a user-defined global positioning system approach to Runway 31, contrary to regulations and safe practices.

FINDINGS AS TO RISK
1. At the time of the approach, the reported ceiling and visibility were well below the minima published on the approach chart.
2. Because the runway was not equipped with a reporting runway visual range system, flying the NDB approach was allowable under the existing regulations.
3. The crew did not follow company SOPs for the approach and missed-approach briefings.
4. Both crew members had surpassed their maximum monthly and quarterly flight times and maximum daily flight duty times. They were thus at increased risk of fatigue, which leads to judgement and performance errors.
5. The first officer likely suffered from chronic fatigue, having worked an average of 14 hours a day for the last 30 days, with only 1 day of rest.
6. Transport Canada was not aware that the company's pilots were exceeding the flight and duty times.
7. The company operations manager did not effectively supervise the flight and duty times of company pilots.
8. The captain had not received the mandatory training in pilot decision making or crew resource management.

OTHER FINDINGS
1. The emergency locator transmitter activated on initial impact but ceased to transmit shortly thereafter when its antenna cable was severed.

He then contacted Air Traffic Control. During this radio transmission, the MASTER WARNING and right AC bus (R AC BUS) warning captions illuminated, closely followed by illumination of the right fuel low pressure (R FUEL PRESS LOW) warning.
The crew immediately carried out the company check list actions for the right AC bus failure, but decided not to implement the actions for the right fuel low pressure warning as the aircraft was close to the terminal. The checklist actions for the right low fuel pressure indication required the standby boost pump to be switched on. The co-pilot then detected an acrid smell in the cockpit and alerted the pilot to flames he had observed coming from the underside of the right engine nacelle. The pilot in command immediately brought the aircraft to a stop, shutting down both engines.
Although there was no engine fire warning indication, the crew operated both engine fire handles, making several unsuccessful attempts to discharge the right engine fire bottle. The co-pilot then evacuated the passengers through the forward cabin door, directing them to the flood lit terminal apron area. The pilot in command alerted the RAAF fire personnel by radio of the fire, before turning off the aircraft power and vacating the aircraft.
Two of the operator's maintenance engineers, awaiting the aircraft's arrival, had noticed the flames emanating from the wheel well area as the aircraft approached. They had immediately picked up two dry chemical powder fire extinguishers and approached the aircraft. Following the feathering of the right propeller, they discharged the contents of both fire extinguishers into the right main landing gear wheel well area, extinguishing the fire. The military fire tender arrived soon after to assist.

SIGNIFICANT FACTORS:
1. The right wing landing light wiring cable tie stand-offs were not installed.
2. The right wing landing light wiring was in contact with the surface of one or more fuel lines in the right wing equipment bay.
3. The wiring had electrically arced on the surface of one or both of the fuel lines resulting in holes being made in the fuel line walls with resultant fuel leaks from each line.
4. The fuel had ignited resulting in fire damage to the adjacent aircraft structure.
5. The fuel leaks were unable to be stopped by the flightcrew."

The departure controller on initial contact cleared the Beech 1900D to 7000 feet and to turn to a heading of 010 degrees passing through 3000 feet, for vectors around the slower traffic. The aircraft was later cleared to maintain 16 000 feet and, while climbing through 6100 feet, entered airspace in which the minimum vectoring altitude was 7000 feet. It reached 7000 feet approximately 2.5 nautical miles inside the boundary and was subsequently cleared to maintain 8000 feet and later 11 000 feet. While climbing through 8400 feet, it entered airspace in which the minimum vectoring altitude was 9000 feet. The Beech 1900D reached 9000 feet approximately 20 seconds or about 1.5 nautical miles after penetrating the 9000-foot minimum vectoring altitude area.

He also stated that, 'The aircraft departed the runway surface at which point a propeller blade impacted an unknown object that severed the blade from the hub and causing it to impact the fuselage.' A representative at the airport reported that snow plowing operations were being conducted at the time of the accident, when the driver of the snow plow heard the aircraft report on the Unicom frequency. At this time, the snow plowing operations were suspended. About 45 minutes elapsed before the aircraft touched down. The report also indicates that the runway had not been plowed to its full width and that the south side of the runway had not been plowed. The report also indicates that no radio communications were made with the flight crew regarding updated runway conditions. Airport condition reports from the day of the accident indicate that there was a snowbank approximately 24 inches high on the south side of the runway.

Probable Cause: the failure of the flightcrew to maintain directional control due to unsafe/hazardous conditions on the runway that was not relayed to them. Factors were the uneven snow covered runway and the snowbank.

The Beechcraft 1900 aircraft was carrying 17 passengers and two crew members on a domestic flight from Bucaramanga to CÃºcuta. The prisoner was escorted aboard the plane by two armed police guards but was not handcuffed. Approximately eight minutes after takeoff from Palo Negro Airport, the hijacker produced a knife. He forced the pilots to land the plane at an airstrip near El Tornillo, located approximately 150 kilometers north of Bogota. The hijacker then fled into the jungle, taking one of the guards as a hostage. A right-wing paramilitary unit observed the plane land at the airstrip, chased and killed the hijacker, and released the hostage."

As the last passenger approached the first step of the airstairs, he 'lost his balance,' and reached for the right side guide cable. The top anchor bracket of the guide cable became disconnected and the passenger fell down the stairs, striking the pavement with his right side. The anchor bracket was manufactured from an aluminum casting. Five months after the accident, a service bulletin was issued which addressed replacement of the upper anchor brackets for the airstair door forward and aft handrail cables. The replacement was required due to reports of separations of the upper anchor brackets. The bulletin also stated, 'Separation of these handrail cable upper anchor brackets can result in the airstair door becoming unstable in addition to loss of handrail support for crew, maintenance personnel or passengers when using the handrail.' The new upper anchor bracket was an improved design machined from steel alloy.

Probable Cause: The failure of the upper anchor bracket for the airstair door.

They said the ramp area was dark and the aircraft's taxi, navigation and tail floodlights were illuminated, and the windshield wipers were operating. The captain said that during taxi, the yellow guideline into the ramp area was very difficult to see, but he was taxiing the aircraft within 10 feet of the line. Both crewmembers said they never saw the tug until after the collision, and when the aircraft door was opened, they realized that the baggage vehicle had collided with their aircraft. The police report showed that the pilot had said in his initial report, that he felt as if the left wing had been pushed hard and he had observed that the aircraft's left propeller and wing, as well as the rear baggage carts were damaged. The police report also showed that the baggage cart had been equipped with no lights, only reflectors, and that the distance from the center of the yellow taxi line to the impact point where the debris lay was about 30 feet. In addition, a ramp control incident report showed that in addition to the debris being located 30 feet from the yellow line, the debris was also located 73 feet from the aircraft containment line. The tug driver stated that he had been driving as close to the fuchsia (red) line as was possible, when the collision occurred. The ramp supervisor who was marshalling the aircraft and witnessed the collision stated that he was 100 feet away, and observed that the tug and cart was coming from the left side of the aircraft, trying to cross the taxiway from one side to the other, and the tug driver did not notice the aircraft taxiing in, and tried to avoid hitting the aircraft by making a turn to the left, but he hit the airplane with the cart, causing damage to the airplane's left wing and propeller.

Probable Cause: Inadequate visual lookout by the driver of the vehicle.

The F/O reported only verbally briefing the passenger adjacent to the door about the door opening procedures but did not demonstrate. After takeoff at 800 feet 800 feet msl, the forward airstair door opened. An emergency was declared, the flight returned and landed uneventfully. The propeller blades and aft cables of the forward airstair door were damaged; the door latching mechanism operated normally. The company F/O's are taught to verbally discuss with passengers the door opening procedure without demonstrating. Several of the company F/O's reported partially opening the forward airstair door to demonstrate the procedure to the passenger; accomplishing this after closing and locking the door. Post incident, the F/O was vague about how to verify that the forward airstair door is locked. The results of drug screening of the captain and FO were negative.

Probable Cause: The failure of the first officer to comply with procedures and directives for his failure to assure that the forward airstair door was closed and locked. A contributing factor in the incident was the inoperative annunciation system of the forward airstair door.

Examination of the landing gear system revealed that maintenance personnel had improperly installed the landing gear service valve 6 days prior, by reversing two hydraulic lines. Reasons for the electrical malfunction of the landing gear service valve could not be determined. The airplane's maintenance manual did not refer to the cycling of the landing gear, mechanically or electrically, after replacement of the landing gear service valve.

Probable Cause: The reversal of landing gear hydraulic lines by company maintenance personnel. Factors related to the incident were the manufacturers omission of maintenance procedures, and the failure of an electrical switch for undetermined reasons.

Attempts to lock the nose gear were unsuccessful; the nose gear collapsed during the landing roll. The emergency hand pump was unable to build pressure in secondary system due to leakage past the shuttle valve and the shuttle bore in the end cap of the left gear actuator; excessive clearance was noted. The shuttle valve or bore were not worn or damaged. During manufacturing, the shuttle bore and shuttle valve are honed and lapped to fit and kept as matching parts; clearance limits are not specified. Functional testing detects excessive clearance. Overhaul procedures do not require honing of the shuttle bore. The power pack motor was inoperative with a ""load"" applied. The left actuator was overhauled August 1998; during overhaul the shuttle and end cap were not replaced. The overhauled actuator was installed February 2000. Emergency extension and rigging checks required by the airline job card and maintenance manual respectively were not performed following actuator installation. Emergency extension check was accomplished last approximately 4 months earlier; the maintenance manual does not indicate application of force to the tires during extension check using the emergency hand pump. The airplane had accumulated approximately 1,475 hours and 1,746 cycles since actuator installation and 18,302 hours and 23,315 cycles since power pack assembly installation.

Probable Cause: The excessive clearance between the shuttle valve and the shuttle bore in the end cap of the left main landing gear actuator for undetermined reasons either during overhaul or manufacturing resulting in failure to build hydraulic pressure using the emergency hand pump. A finding in the investigation was the failure of the airplane manufacturer to identify procedures in the maintenance manual that would detect the above listed condition during check of the emergency hand pump.

During the landing roll, and after activation of the Decoto power steering system, the airplane suddenly veered to the right. The airplane continued off the right side of the runway, into an area of soft terrain, and the nose landing gear collapsed. In a written statement to the NTSB, the captain of the accident airplane wrote, in part: ""Because of the strong winds, it was necessary to engage the power steering to assist with the left turn, a normal procedure. As I engaged the power steering, which was armed by the first officer at my request, the aircraft executed an immediate right turn of approximately 45 degrees. Both the first officer and myself attempted to counter-respond the event with full left rudder and maximum left braking. All attempts were unsuccessful, causing us to exit the runway, collapsing the nose gear, and sheering the props."" In the presence of NTSB and FAA investigators, extensive tests were conducted on the Decoto power steering system, and associated components. No preaccident mechanical anomalies were noted with the system. The Flight Data Recorder revealed that the crew activated the power steering system with a derived ground speed of about 40 to 50 knots. The Decoto Power Steering System flight manual supplement states: ""Use of power steering is limited to taxi operations only.""

Probable Cause: The flight crew's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll. A factor associated with the accident was the crew's failure to follow appropriate procedures.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 121 as Great Lakes Flight 6798 and was on an active instrument flight plan. The captain and first officer (FO) reported no injuries. Eight passengers were released from the accident scene without treatment and seven passengers were transported to local area hospitals for evaluation and treatment of minor injuries. The flight originated at the Capital Airport, Springfield, Illinois at 1605.

The crew unintentionally landed the airplane with the landing gear in the fully retracted position. The crew did not lower the landing gear or check the landing gear position as required on the flaps-up landing checklist, the normal landing checklist, and final checklist. According to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), the landing gear unsafe warning horn did not sound during the entire recorded portion of the accident flight. The minimum equipment list (MEL) requires the installation of a placard that prohibits the silencing of the landing gear warning horn when the flap system is inoperative. The accident airplane had a placard that stated, ""Do not silence gear warning horn."" No anomalies were found with the landing gear system including the landing gear unsafe warning horn, the red landing gear control handle lighting, and the landing gear position lights. The flap system and ground proximity warning system (GPWS) were inoperative for the accident flight and were listed on the MEL as items that could be inoperative for revenue flight.

Probable Cause: The flightcrew not lowering the landing gear and/or verifying the landing gear position as required by three separate checklists, which resulted in an inadvertent gear-up landing. A factor to the accident was the flightcrew not complying with the required minimum equipment list placard that prohibited the silencing of the landing gear warning horn.

The separation between the two aircraft became so small that the Beech crew had to take evasive action.

The Beech aircraft, arriving from Braunschweig, was under radar control by Ingolstadt (INGO) Radar. The crew had previously received traffic information from INGO Radar about an unknown military aircraft, likely a helicopter. Shortly before entering the control zone, the crew observed a single-engine aircraftâ€”a Piaggioâ€”climbing steeply with its cabin facing away. The crew disengaged the autopilot and performed an evasive maneuver to the right (15Â° right turn, according to the flight recorder) combined with an increased rate of descent. The Beech passed the other aircraft at a lateral distance of about 300 feet.

The Piaggio had taken off from Ingolstadt on a training flight for a military type rating. After takeoff from runway 25L, the aircraft turned north. The crew had set the transponder to code 0033 and maintained radio contact with INGO Tower. North of the control zone, in Class E airspace, they began the flight maneuvers specified in the training plan. Toward the end, several â€œLazy Eightâ€ maneuvers were performed. During the final one, the trainee warned the instructor, who was flying at the time: â€œNot to the leftâ€”traffic ahead.â€ The instructor aborted the maneuver and pulled up while turning right. The Piaggio crew confirmed the lateral distance to the Beech.

No coordination regarding the Piaggioâ€™s flight had taken place between INGO Tower and INGO Radar."

As the airplane continued to slow down the airplane began to pull to the left. The flight crew stopped the airplane on the runway. During the post-flight examination of the airplane the pilot discovered that the left main landing gear had turned 90 degrees to the left. The examination also revealed a fatigue fracture in the left main landing gear socket assembly. Examination of the socket assembly fracture revealed two fatigue regions initiated from the lower corner lug base radii and along the left and right base radii with multiple origins. Both the lower lug corner radii were confirmed to show marks consistent with repair blending. According to the blend repair procedure the surface is to be blended to surface finish comparable to that produced by 250 grit sand paper. A comparison was made between the surface finish in the repair area, and the surface produce by 240 grit sand paper on the part, which is slightly coarser than the 250 grit required. The surface finish in the repair region was much rougher than that produced by 240 grit sand paper.

Probable Cause: The improper service of the left main landing gear socket, resulting in fatigue failure of the left main landing gear socket assembly at the lower scissor attachment point.

On the morning of the accident the airplane departed Mena at 06:20. The Beech was flown to Wichita to pick up the CEO/President of Hageland Airlines, who was the airline's representative to accept delivery and finalize the purchase of the airplane. The airplane arrived at 07:45. The Beech was to fly back to Mena a few hours later so the CEO could authorize a pre-purchase agreement for another 1900C. Departed from Wichita was at 10:43 on a VFR flight to Mena. At 11:30 the airplane began to descend from its cruising altitude of 15,500 feet. Last radio contact was at 11:36 when the airplane was descending through approx. 5000 feet. Descent was continued until flew into rising, heavily wooded, mountainous terrain. The accident site elevation was 2,050 feet msl, about 200 feet below the top of a mountain ridgeline. Reportedly cloud layers were obscuring the ridgeline about the time of the accident.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""In-flight collision with terrain due to the pilot's failure to maintain clearance and altitude above rapidly rising terrain while on a VFR approach. Contributing factors were the obscuration of the terrain due to clouds.""

The 21 occupants aboard the
airplane were killed.
The accident airplane had undergone a detail six (D6) maintenance check between the night of January 6 and the morning of January 7, 2003. During this check the elevator cable tension was adjusted.
In the process the elevator control system was incorrectly rigged, restricted the airplaneÂ’s elevator travel to 7Âº airplane nose down, or about one-half of the normal downward travel. This error was not detected prior to release to service.
The airplane returned to service on the morning of January 7 and flew a total of nine flight legs before the accident flight.
At 08:37 the aircraft was ready for taxi for a flight to Greenville-Spartanburg Airport, South Carolina, USA. At 08:46 the flight was cleared for takeoff from runway 18R. One minute later, immediately after the landing gear had been retracted, the nose pitched up to 20Â°. Both crew members reacted with surprise and the captain asked the first officer to help him.
Both flight crew then attempted forcefully push the nose down. The nose continued to pitch up to 54Â° and the stall warning horn sounded. The aircraft's nose dropped and it rolled 127Â° to the left.
The airplaneÂ’s roll attitude then stabilized at about 20Âº left wing down; the pitch attitude began to increase. About 08:47:24 the airplane rolled right through wings level, and the pitch attitude increased to about -5Âº. The nose dropped again and the airplane struck a US Airways maintenance hangar and came to rest about 1650 feet east of the runway 18R centerline and about 7600 feet beyond the runway 18R threshold.

It appeared that, aside from the limit nose down elevator travel, the aircraft had an excessive aft center of gravity due to substantially inaccurate weight and balance calculations.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The airplaneÂ’s loss of pitch control during takeoff. The loss of pitch control resulted from the incorrect rigging of the elevator control system compounded by the airplaneÂ’s aft center of gravity, which was substantially aft of the certified aft limit. Contributing to the cause of the accident was: (1) Air MidwestÂ’s lack of oversight of the work being performed at the Huntington, West Virginia, maintenance station; (2) Air MidwestÂ’s maintenance procedures and documentation; (3) Air MidwestÂ’s weight and balance program at the time of the accident; (4) the Raytheon Aerospace quality assurance inspectorÂ’s failure to detect the incorrect rigging of the elevator system; (5) the FAAÂ’s average weight assumptions in its weight and balance program guidance at the time of the accident; and (6) the FAAÂ’s lack of oversight of Air MidwestÂ’s maintenance program and its weight and balance program.""

They noted no other anomalies and seemed to have full flight control authority. However, as a precaution, the flight crew elected to return and land at the departure airport. The crew reported that the landing was normal with the exception of the required control wheel offset. A post incident examination of the aileron control system revealed a 360Âº fracture in the silver-brazed joint between the drive sprocket and its mating shaft of the left-hand aileron control sprocket assembly. The failure of the brazed joint allowed both control wheels to be rotated approximately 45 degrees from neutral without a corresponding aileron control surface response. NTSB metallurgical examination of the left-hand sprocket assembly revealed that it was not brazed according to the referenced specifications. Specifically, the examination noted that the braze filler material had been introduced from both ends of the joint, resulting in a lack of penetration of about 20 percent of the total joint area. The applicable specification states, ""the filler metal shall be introduced at one edge...and shall flow by capillary action to fill the interstice."" The NTSB's review of the incident aircraft's maintenance records showed that a flight data recorder (FDR) functional check was completed the night before the incident flight. The roll control parameter, which is designed to measure the aileron surface position, was one of the parameters checked. To verify the accuracy of this parameter, the left control wheel is rotated either clockwise or counterclockwise until the ailerons contact their respective up or down stops. When the stops are contacted, the control wheel is held in position and the FDR roll control parameter value is checked against an approved maintenance manual limit. The control wheel is then rotated in the opposite direction and the FDR parameter is verified. The mechanic who conducted the functional check reported that the FDR functional check was routine. NTSB analysis of available recorded FDR data, incident flight and over 83 flights before the incident flight, showed that the maximum values recorded for the FDR roll control parameter prior to the functional check were 14.6 degrees aileron trailing edge down (TED) and 23.4 degrees aileron trailing edge up (TEU). The recorded aileron TED value was not in the range required by the approved operators B1900D maintenance inspection procedures document. The analysis also showed that, during the FDR functional check, the maximum values recorded for the roll parameter exceeded the maximum values recorded prior to the incident by 1.9 degrees in the aileron TED direction and 1.0 degree in the aileron TEU direction. This was the only time that both FDR values for the roll control parameter were in the TED range required by the functional check. The aircraft manufacturer and the NTSB tested the aileron control system on an exemplar Beechcraft 1900D aircraft in Wichita. The purpose of the test was to determine the amount of tangential force, applied to the control wheel, required to change the FDR roll control parameter value by 1.9 degrees in the aileron TED direction. Results of the testing showed that an additional tangential force of 80 pounds applied to the control wheel, after it was rotated such that an aileron was resting against its control surface stop, increased the roll parameter value by 0.7 degrees in the aileron TED direction and 1.3 degrees aileron TEU. Additional force was not applied to the control wheel because the limit load for the aileron control system is 80.4 pounds. The airplane manufacturer provided a Beechcraft 1900D Engineering report that documented tests that were conducted on the aileron control system to demonstrate compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations. Test data show that the aileron system did not yield while applying a limit tangential load of 80.4 pounds to the control wheel or fail when an ultimate tangential load of 120.6 pounds was applied to the control wheel. The aileron control system, including the brazed joint on the sprocket assembly, met all Federal Aviation Administration airworthiness standards for commuter-category aircraft. The investigation concluded that the failed sprocket assembly significantly reduced the pilots' control of the ailerons because the failure affects pilot input from both control wheels.


Probable Cause: Failure of the aileron sprocket assembly at the sprocket-to-shaft braze joint. Contributing factors were the improper braze procedure used by the part manufacturer at the time of fabrication which resulted in an inferior quality joint and the inadequate quality control (inspection) criteria which failed to identify the improperly brazed joint. An additional factor was the improper inspection procedure utilized by the operator's maintenance personnel, during which excessive force was applied to the control wheel in order to obtain acceptable flight data recorder readings during the functional check.

He said, ""All checks of the cabin and cargo door circuitry appeared normal."" The first officer said that the airstair door operated normally during the three previous flights that day. He reported that on the incident flight, he ""did not note any abnormalities as far as the operation/locking of the forward airstair door."" He said that the cabin door annunciator light went out as normal after closing and locking the cabin door. He and the captain verified that the doors were closed and the annunciator lights were out. The captain reported that approximately 5 minutes into the flight and passing 8,000 feet msl, the cabin door warning light illuminated. The captain said they ran the checklist, which directed the passengers to ensure their seat belts were fastened. The captain said he directed the first officer to tell approach control that they were returning to the airport. The captain said they did not declare an emergency at that time. The captain said that approximately 2 minutes after the cabin door warning light illuminated, he initiated a 20 to 25 degree bank left turn to take them back to the airport. During the turn, the captain said he heard a pop and the cabin door came open causing damage to the door, doorframe, and left propeller. The captain said they declared an emergency and landed with the cabin door open. An examination of the cabin airstair door showed no anomalies with the locking mechanism and circuitry. An examination of the door sensor to the forward cabin door warning light showed that the door handle could be placed in a position where the door's pressure lock plunger was just engaging the latch plate, but had not dropped into the ""keyhole,"" and the warning light would go out. When moving the handle through the closed position so that the handle could no longer move forward, the pressure lock plunger would fully engage in its ""seated position"" and the warning light would go out.



Probable Cause: the first officer's improper preflight preparation in failing to ensure the cabin airstair door was fully locked and secure. Factors relating to the incident were the cabin airstair door handle not being fully secure and the forward cabin door warning light not illuminating until the airplane was in flight.

The phase check was interrupted, and the remaining work was deferred on the morning of August 24. Ten revenue flight legs were completed that day, and the Detail Six phase check resumed on the evening of August 24, and concluded on August 26. During the check both elevator trim actuators were replaced. During this procedure the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) was not strictly followed and the elevator trim tab cable unwound off the forward drum. The forward elevator trim tab cable was then replaced. During the replacement of the cable, the maintenance personnel skipped a step in the AMM. They did not use a lead wire to assist with cable orientation. In addition, the AMM incorrectly depicted the elevator trim drum, and the depiction of the orientation of the cable around the drum was ambiguous.
On the evening of August 26, N240CJ was to be repositioned to Albany. When the flightcrew received the airplane, the captain did not address the recent cable change noted on his maintenance release. The captain also did not perform a first flight of the day checklist, which included an elevator trim check.
Shortly after takeoff from runway 24 the pitch trim control moved from 1.5 to approximately 3 degrees negative (nose down). Ten seconds later the pitch trim control moved to an approximate 7 degree negative position, where it remained for the duration of the flight. The pilot declared an emergency and reported a ""runaway trim."" The airplane flew in a left turn and reached an altitude of approximately 1,100 feet. The flightcrew subsequently requested to land on runway 33, upon which ATC cleared the flight to land on any runway. While attempting to return to the airport, the plane then pitched nose-down, and impacted the water at an approximate 30-degree angle. The Beech came to rest in approximately 18 feet of water, about 100 yards from the Yarmouth shore.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The improper replacement of the forward elevator trim cable, and subsequent inadequate functional check of the maintenance performed, which resulted in a reversal of the elevator trim system and a loss of control in-flight. Factors were the flightcrew's failure to follow the checklist procedures, and the aircraft manufacturer's erroneous depiction of the elevator trim drum in the maintenance manual.""
